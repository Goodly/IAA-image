They say the statistical techniques used by the original team were too simplistic, and were based on a model devised in the 1930s, which can't reliability be applied to the growing supernova dataset.

They also mention that the cosmic microwave background isn't directly affected by dark energy, so only serves as an ""indirect"" type of evidence"
