For the study, researchers from Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of  Public Health looked at 375,000 Medicare patients who turned up in an emergency department for common reasons — such as falls, chest pain, ankle sprain, or back pain — and hadn’t used opioids in the six months before their hospital stay",5385

This was a clever study design, since the major difference between the groups was how the doctors prescribed opioids, which allowed the researchers to figure out whether the prescribing patterns influenced patients’ long-term use of painkillers. (In the study, “long-term use” was described as six or more months of daily opioids in the 12-month period following the ER visit.)

It turns out the doctors’ actions mattered hugely. The patients who saw the heavy opioid prescribers were three times more likely to receive a prescription for opioids compared with the patients who saw the more judicious opioid prescribers at the same hospital. The high prescribers doled out opioids to a quarter of their patients, while the more conservative prescribers only treated 7 percent with opioids on average, a variation the researchers thought was likely the result of inappropriate prescribing",5385
