The study authors then split the group into patients who happened to be assigned to doctors who prescribed a lot of opioids, and patients who met doctors who didn’t. This was a clever study design, since the major difference between the groups was how the doctors prescribed opioids, which allowed the researchers to figure out whether the prescribing patterns influenced patients’ long-term use of painkillers. (In the study, “long-term use” was described as six or more months of daily opioids in the 12-month period following the ER visit"

The patients who saw the heavy opioid prescribers were three times more likely to receive a prescription for opioids compared with the patients who saw the more judicious opioid prescribers at the same hospital. The high prescribers doled out opioids to a quarter of their patients, while the more conservative prescribers only treated 7 percent with opioids on average, a variation the researchers thought was likely the result of inappropriate prescribing"

This may result in a shift of brain position or compression"

The scans showed that areas that saw increases in gray matter were the sections that process movement information, and more specifically the movement of a person’s legs. The team believes that may be related to the brain working harder to learn new ways of moving related to the lack of gravity. The scans also showed that the changes were more dramatic in the astronauts who spent months aboard the ISS as opposed to those who only had brief trips aboard the shuttle"
