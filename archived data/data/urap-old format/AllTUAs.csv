But with its\nhuge potential come pressing concerns.\n\n\nThree years ago, Bruce Conklin came across a method that made\nhim change the course of his lab.\nConklin, a geneticist at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco,\nCalifornia, had been trying to work out how variations in DNA affect various\nhuman diseases, but his tools were cumbersome. When he worked\nwith cells from patients, it was hard to know which sequences were important\nfor disease and which were just background noise. And engineering a\nmutation into cells was expensive and laborious work. “It was a student’s\nentire thesis to change one gene,” he says.\n\nThen, in 2012, he read about a newly published technique1\n calledCRISPR that would allow researchers to quickly change the DNA of nearly\nany organism — including humans. Soon after, Conklin abandoned his\nprevious approach to modelling disease and adopted this new one. His lab\nis now feverishly altering genes associated with various heart conditions.\n“CRISPR is turning everything on its head,” he says.\nThe sentiment is widely shared: CRISPR is causing a major upheaval\nin biomedical research. Unlike other gene-editing methods, it is cheap,\nquick and easy to use, and it has swept through labs around the world as\na result. Researchers hope to use it to adjust human genes to eliminate diseases,\ncreate hardier plants, wipe out pathogens and much more besides.\n“I’ve seen two huge developments since I’ve been in science: CRISPR and\nPCR,” says John Schimenti, a geneticist at Cornell University in Ithaca,\nNew York. Like PCR, the gene-amplification method that revolutionized\ngenetic engineering after its invention in 1985, “CRISPR is impacting the\nlife sciences in so many ways,” he says.\nBut although CRISPR has much to offer, some scientists are worried\n\n[Image...ILLUSTRATIONS BY SÉBASTIEN THIBAULT\n20 | NATURE | VOL 522 | 4 JUNE 2015\n© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved]\n\n\nthat the field’s breakneck pace leaves little time for addressing the ethical\nand safety concerns such experiments can raise. The problem was\nthrust into the spotlight in April, when news broke that scientists had used\nCRISPR to engineer human embryos (see Nature 520, 593–595; 2015).\nThe embryos they used were unable to result in a live birth, but the report2\nhas generated heated debate over whether and how CRISPR should be\nused to make heritable changes to the human genome. And there are other\nconcerns. Some scientists want to see more studies that probe whether\nthe technique generates stray and potentially risky genome edits; others\nworry that edited organisms could disrupt entire ecosystems. “This power\nis so easily accessible by labs — you don’t need a very expensive piece of\nequipment and people don’t need to get many years of training to do this,”\nsays Stanley Qi, a systems biologist at Stanford University in California.\n“We should think carefully about how we are going to use that power.”\n\nRESEARCH REVOLUTION\nBiologists have long been able to edit genomes with molecular tools.\nAbout ten years ago, they became excited by enzymes called zinc finger\nnucleases that promised to do this accurately and efficiently. But zinc\nfingers, which cost US$5,000 or more to order, were not widely adopted\nbecause they are difficult to engineer and expensive, says James Haber, a\nmolecular biologist at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts.\nCRISPR works differently: it relies on an enzyme called Cas9 that uses a\nguide RNA molecule to home in on its target DNA, then edits the DNA\nto disrupt genes or insert desired sequences. Researchers often need to\norder only the RNA fragment; the other components can be bought off\nthe shelf. Total cost: as little as $30. “That effectively democratized the\ntechnology so that everyone is using it,” says Haber. “It’s a huge revolution.”\nCRISPR methodology is quickly eclipsing zinc finger nucleases and\nother editing tools (see ‘The rise of CRISPR’). For some, that means\nabandoning techniques they had taken years to perfect. “I’m depressed,”\nsays Bill Skarnes, a geneticist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in\nHinxton, UK, “but I’m also excited.” Skarnes had spent much of his career\nusing a technology introduced in the mid-1980s: inserting DNA into\nembryonic stem cells and then using those cells to generate genetically\nmodified mice. The technique became a laboratory workhorse, but it was\nalso time-consuming and costly. CRISPR takes a fraction of the time, and\nSkarnes adopted the technique two years ago.\nResearchers have traditionally relied heavily on model organisms\nsuch as mice and fruit flies, partly because they were the only species\nthat came with a good tool kit for genetic manipulation. Now CRISPR\nis making it possible to edit genes in many more organisms. In April, for\nexample, researchers at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research\nin Cambridge, Massachusetts, reported using CRISPR to study Candida\nalbicans, a fungus that is particularly deadly in people with weakened\nimmune systems, but had been difficult to genetically manipulate in the\nlab3. \n\nJennifer Doudna, a CRISPR pioneer at the University of California,\nBerkeley, is keeping a list of CRISPR-altered creatures. So far, she has three\ndozen entries, including disease-causing parasites called trypanosomes\nand yeasts used to make biofuels.\nYet the rapid progress has its drawbacks. “People just don’t have the\ntime to characterize some of the very basic parameters of the system,”\nsays Bo Huang, a biophysicist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n“There is a mentality that as long as it works, we don’t have to\nunderstand how or why it works.” That means that researchers occasionally\nrun up against glitches. Huang and his lab struggled for two months\nto adapt CRISPR for use in imaging studies. He suspects that the delay\nwould have been shorter had more been known about how to optimize\nthe design of guide RNAs, a basic but important nuance.\nBy and large, researchers see these gaps as a minor price to pay for a\npowerful technique. But Doudna has begun to have more serious concerns\nabout safety.\n\nHer worries began at ameeting in 2014, whenshe saw a postdoc present\nwork in which a virus was engineered to carry the CRISPR components into mice. The\nmice breathed in the virus, allowing the CRISPR system to engineer mutations\nand create a model for human lung cancer4. \n\nDoudna got a chill; a\nminor mistake in the design of the guide RNA could result in a CRISPR\nthat worked in human lungs as well. “It seemed incredibly scary that you\nmight have students who were working with such a thing,” she says. “It’s\nimportant for people to appreciate what this technology can do.”\nAndrea Ventura, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering\nCancer Center in New York and a lead author of the work, says that his\nlab carefully considered the safety implications: the guide sequences were\ndesigned to target genome regions that were unique to mice, and the virus\nwas disabled such that it could not replicate. He agrees that it is important\nto anticipate even remote risks. “The guides are not designed to cut the\nhuman genome, but you never know,” he says. “It’s not very likely, but it\nstill needs to be considered.”\n\nEDITING OUT DISEASE\nLast year, bioengineer Daniel Anderson of the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology in Cambridge and his colleagues used CRISPR in mice to correct\na mutation associated with a human metabolic disease called tyrosinaemia5\n. It was the first use of CRISPR to fix a disease-causing mutation\nin an adult animal — and an important step towards using the technology\nfor gene therapy in humans.\n\nThe idea that CRISPR could accelerate the gene-therapy field is a\nmajor source of excitement in scientific and biotechnology circles. But as\nwell as highlighting the potential, Anderson’s study showed how far there\nis to go. To deliver the Cas9 enzyme and its guide RNA into the target\norgan, the liver, the team had to pump large volumes of liquid into blood\nvessels — something that is not generally considered feasible in people.\nAnd the experiments corrected the disease-causing mutation in just 0.4%\nof the cells, which is not enough to have an impact on many diseases.\nOver the past two years, a handful of companies have sprung up to\ndevelop CRISPR-based gene therapy, and Anderson and others say that\nthe first clinical trials of such a treatment could happen in the next one\nor two years. Those first trials will probably be scenarios in which the\nCRISPR components can be injected directly into tissues, such as those\nin the eye, or in which cells can be removed from the body, engineered in\nthe lab and then put back. For example, blood-forming stem cells might be\ncorrected to treat conditions such as sickle-cell disease or β-thalassaemia.\nIt will be a bigger challenge to deliver the enzyme and guide RNA into\nmany other tissues, but researchers hope that the technique could one day\nbe used to tackle a wider range of genetic diseases.\nYet many scientists caution that there is much to do before CRISPR\ncan be deployed safely and efficiently. Scientists need to increase the\nefficiency of editing, but at the same time make sure that they do not\nintroduce changes elsewhere in the genome that have consequences for\nhealth. “These enzymes will cut in places other than the places you have\ndesigned them to cut, and that has lots of implications,” says Haber. “If\nyou’re going to replace somebody’s sickle-cell gene in a stem cell, you’re\ngoing to be asked, ‘Well, what other damage might you have done at other\nsites in the genome?’”\n\nKeith Joung, who studies gene editing at Massachusetts General Hospital\nin Boston, has been developing methods to hunt down Cas9’s off-target\ncuts. He says that the frequency of such cuts varies widely from cell to\ncell and from one sequence to another: his lab and others have seen offtarget\nsites with mutation frequencies ranging from 0.1% to more than\n60%. Even low-frequency events could potentially be dangerous if they\naccelerate a cell’s growth and lead to cancer, he says.\nWith so many unanswered questions, it is important to keep\nexpectations of CRISPR under control, says Katrine Bosley, chief executive\nof Editas, a company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that is pursuing\nCRISPR-mediated gene therapy. Bosley is a veteran of commercializing\nnew technologies, and says that usually the hard part is convincing others\nthat an approach will work. “With CRISPR it’s almost the opposite,” she\nsays. “There’s so much excitement and support, but we have to be realistic\nabout what it takes to get there.”\n\nCRISPR ON THE FARM\n\nWhile Anderson and others are aiming to modify DNA in human cells,\nothers are targeting crops and livestock. Before the arrival of geneediting\ntechniques, this was generally done by inserting a gene into\nthe genome at random positions, along with sequences from bacteria,\nviruses or other species that drive expression of the gene. But the process\nis inefficient, and it has always been fodder for critics who dislike\nthe mixing of DNA from different species or worry that the insertion\ncould interrupt other genes. What is more, getting genetically modified\ncrops approved for use is so complex and expensive that most of\nthose that have been modified are large commodity crops such as maize\n(corn) and soya beans.\n\nWith CRISPR, the situation could change: the ease and low cost may\nmake genome editing a viable option for smaller, speciality crops, as\nwell as animals.In the past few years, researchers have used the method\nto engineer petite pigs and to make disease-resistant wheat and rice.\nThey have also made progress towards engineering dehorned cattle,\ndisease-resistant goats and vitamin-enriched sweet oranges. Doudna\nanticipates that her list of CRISPR-modified organisms will grow.\n“There’s an interesting opportunity to consider doing experiments or\nengineering pathways in plants that are not as important commercially\nbut are very interesting from a research perspective — or for home\nvegetable gardens,” she says.\nCRISPR’s ability to precisely edit existing DNA sequences makes\nfor more-accurate modifications, but it also makes it more difficult\nfor regulators and farmers to identify a modified organism once it\nhas been released. “With gene editing, there’s no longer the ability to\nreally track engineered products,” says Jennifer Kuzma, who studies\nscience policy at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. “It will\nbe hard to detect whether something has been mutated conventionally\nor genetically engineered.”\n\nThat rings alarm bells for opponents of genetically modified crops,\nand it poses difficult questions for countries trying to work out how to\nregulate gene-edited plants and animals. In the United States, the Food\nand Drug Administration has yet to approve any genetically modified\nanimal for human consumption, and it has not yet announced how it\nwill handle gene-edited animals.\nUnder existing rules, not all crops made by genome editing would\nrequire regulation by the US Department of Agriculture (see Nature\n500, 389–390; 2013). But in May, the agriculture department began\nto seek input on how it can improve regulation of genetically modified\ncrops — a move that many have taken as a sign that the agency is\nre-evaluating its rules in light of technologies such as CRISPR. “The\nwindow has been cracked,” says Kuzma. “What goes through the window\nremains to be seen. But the fact that it’s even been cracked is\npretty exciting.”\n\nENGINEERED ECOSYSTEMS\nBeyond the farm, researchers are considering how CRISPR could or\nshould be deployed on organisms in the wild. Much of the attention\nhas focused on a method called gene drive, which can quickly sweep\nan edited gene through a population. The work is at an early stage, but\nsuch a technique could be used to wipe out disease-carrying mosquitoes\nor ticks, eliminate invasive plants or eradicate herbicide resistance in\npigweed, which plagues some US farmers.\n\nUsually, a genetic change in one organism takes a long time to spread\nthrough a population. That is because a mutation carried on one of a\npair of chromosomes is inherited by only half the offspring. But a gene\ndrive allows a mutation made by CRISPR on one chromosome to copy\nitself to its partner in every generation, so that nearly all offspring will\ninherit the change. This means that it will speed through a population\nexponentially faster than normal (see ‘Gene drive’) — a mutation\nengineered into a mosquito could spread through a large population\nwithin a season. If that mutation reduced the number of offspring a\nmosquito produced, then the population could be wiped out, along with\nany malaria parasites it is carrying.\n\nBut many researchers are deeply worried that altering an entire\npopulation, or eliminating it altogether, could have drastic and unknown\nconsequences for an ecosystem: it might mean that other pests emerge,\nfor example, or it could affect predators higher up the food chain. And\n “It will be hard to\ndetect whether\nsomething has\nbeen mutated\nconventionally\nor genetically\nengineered.”\n\nTHE RISE OF CRISPR\nDNA sequences called CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic\nrepeats) are part of a bacterial defence system. After researchers showed in 2012\nthat CRISPRs could be used to edit genomes, use of the tools quickly spread, as\nre\u001fected by sharp rises in publications, patent applications and funding.\nThe number of papers about CRISPR has outstripped the numbers mentioning\nthe gene-editing technologies known as TALENs and zinc \u001engers.\n\nPUBLICATIONS\nIn 2014, worldwide patent applications that mention\nCRISPR leapt and a patent battle intensi\u001eed.\nPATENTS\nA sharp jump in US National Institutes of Health funding for\nprojects involving CRISPR is a harbinger of future advances.\nDESIGN BY WES FERNANDES;\nSOURCES: PUBLICATIONS:\nSCOPUS; PATENTS: THE LENS;\nFUNDING: NIH REPORTER.\nFUNDING\n2006 2008 2010 2012 2014\n2008 2010 2012 2014\n50\n100\n150\n200\nPublished patent applications Number of publications\nCRISPR\nTALENs\nZinc\n\u001fngers\niPS\ncells\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\n2007 2009 2011 2013\n2007 2009 2011 2013\n2014\nSpending (US$ millions)\nKey events in the\nCRISPR story.\nA BRIEF\nHISTORY\nOF CRISPR\nDecember 1987\nResearchers \u001end\nCRISPR sequences\nin Escherichia coli,\nbut do not characterize\ntheir function8.\nJuly 1995\nCRISPR sequences are\nfound to be common in\nother microbes9.\nMarch 2007\nScientists at food\ncompany Danisco\ndetermine that the\nrepeats are part of a\nbacterial defence\nagainst viruses10.\nOctober 2011\nCARIBOU BIOSCIENCES\nBerkeley, California\nFocus: Research, industry,\ntherapeutics, agriculture\nRaised:\n$11\nMILLION\nJune 2012\nResearchers report\nthat CRISPR can be\nused to perform\ngenome editing1.\nMarch 2013\nThe University of\nCalifornia and others\n\u001ele for a patent on\nthe \u001endings1.\nJanuary 2013\nCRISPR is used in\nmouse and human cells,\nfuelling rapid uptake of\nthe technique by\nresearchers11–13.\nNovember 2013\nEDITAS MEDICINE\nCambridge, Massachusetts\nFocus: Therapeutics\nRaised:\n$43 MILLION\nApril 2014\nMIT and the Broad\nInstitute are granted a\npatent on CRISPR gene\nediting, sparking a\n\u001eerce patent battle.\nNovember 2013\nCRISPR THERAPEUTICS\nBasel, Switzerland\nFocus: Therapeutics\nRaised:\n$89 MILLION\nNovember 2014\nINTELLIA THERAPEUTICS\nCambridge, MA\nFocus: Therapeutics\nRaised:\n$15\nMILLION\nMarch 2015\nReport of the \u001erst\nCRISPR gene drive,\nwhich can spread an\nedited gene rapidly\nthrough a population6.\nApril 2015\nResearchers report\nthat they have edited\nhuman embryos with\nCRISPR, triggering an\nethical debate2.\nCRISPR funding in\n2014 lagged behind\nthe nearly $160 million\nfor iPS-cell research.\nTOP 5 PATENT APPLICANTS:\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT): 62\nBroad Institute: 57\nMIT bioengineer Feng Zhang: 34\nDanisco: 29\nDow Agrosciences: 28\nPapers mentioning\ninduced pluripotent stem\n(iPS) cells, another rapidly\nadopted technique, are\nshown for comparison.\n0\n0\n400\n800\n1,200\n1,600\nA cluster of biotech\ncompanies has\nsprung up to use\nCRISPR technology.\n2006\nUPDATED ON 8 JUNE 2015 | 4 JUNE 2015 | VOL 522 | NATURE | 23 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved\nresearchers are also mindful that a guide RNA could mutate over time\nsuch that it targets a different part of the genome. This mutation could\nthen race through the population, with unpredictable effects.\n“It has to have a fairly high pay-off, because it has a risk of irreversibility\n— and unintended or hard-to-calculate consequences for\nother species,” says George Church, a bioengineer at Harvard Medical\nSchool in Boston. In April 2014, Church and a team of scientists and\npolicy experts wrote a commentary in Science6\n warning researchers\nabout the risks and proposing ways to guard against accidental release\nof experimental gene drives.\nAt the time, gene drives seemed a distant prospect. But less than\na year later, developmental biologist Ethan Bier of the University of\nCalifornia, San Diego, and his student Valentino Gantz reported that\nthey had designed just such a system in fruit flies7\n. Bier and Gantz had\nused three layers of boxes to contain their flies and adopted lab safety\nmeasures usually used for malaria-carrying mosquitoes. But they did\nnot follow all the guidelines urged by the authors of the commentary,\nsuch as devising a method to reverse the engineered change. Bier says\nthat they were conducting their first proof-of-principle experiments,\nand wanted to know whether the system worked at all before they\nmade it more complex.\n\nFor Church and others, this was a clear warning that the democratization\nof genome editing through CRISPR could have unexpected and\nundesirable outcomes. “It is essential that national regulatory authorities\nand international organizations get on top of this — really get on\ntop of it,” says Kenneth Oye, a political scientist at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology and lead author of the Science commentary.\n“We need more action.” The US National Research Council has formed\na panel to discuss gene drives, and other high-level discussions are\nstarting to take place. But Oye is concerned that the science is moving\nat lightning speed, and that regulatory changes may happen only after\na high-profile gene-drive release.\n\nThe issue is not black and white. Micky Eubanks, an insect ecologist\nat Texas A&M University in College Station, says that the idea of gene\ndrives shocked him at first. “My initial gut reaction was ‘Oh my god, this\nis terrible. It’s so scary’,” he says. “But when you give it more thought and\nweigh it against the environmental changes that we have already made\nand continue to make, it would be a drop in the ocean.”\nSome researchers see lessons for CRISPR in the arc of other new technologies\nthat prompted great excitement, concern and then disappointment\nwhen teething troubles hit. Medical geneticist James Wilson of the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia was at the centre of booming\nenthusiasm over gene therapy in the 1990s — only to witness its downfall\nwhen a clinical trial went wrong and killed a young man. The field\nwent into a tailspin and has only recently begun to recover. The CRISPR\nfield is still young, Wilson says, and it could be years before its potential\nis realized. “It’s in the exploration stage. These ideas need to ferment.”\nThen again, Wilson has been bitten by the CRISPR bug. He says that\nhe was sceptical of all the promises being made about it until his own lab\nbegan to play with the technique. “It’s ultimately going to have a role in\nhuman therapeutics,” he says. “It’s just really spectacular.” ■\nHeidi Ledford is a senior reporter for Nature in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts.\n1.

But with its\nhuge potential come pressing concerns.\n\n\nThree years ago, Bruce Conklin came across a method that made\nhim change the course of his lab.\nConklin, a geneticist at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco,\nCalifornia, had been trying to work out how variations in DNA affect various\nhuman diseases, but his tools were cumbersome. When he worked\nwith cells from patients, it was hard to know which sequences were important\nfor disease and which were just background noise. And engineering a\nmutation into cells was expensive and laborious work. “It was a student’s\nentire thesis to change one gene,” he says.\n\nThen, in 2012, he read about a newly published technique1\n calledCRISPR that would allow researchers to quickly change the DNA of nearly\nany organism — including humans. Soon after, Conklin abandoned his\nprevious approach to modelling disease and adopted this new one. His lab\nis now feverishly altering genes associated with various heart conditions.\n“CRISPR is turning everything on its head,” he says.\nThe sentiment is widely shared: CRISPR is causing a major upheaval\nin biomedical research. Unlike other gene-editing methods, it is cheap,\nquick and easy to use, and it has swept through labs around the world as\na result. Researchers hope to use it to adjust human genes to eliminate diseases,\ncreate hardier plants, wipe out pathogens and much more besides.\n“I’ve seen two huge developments since I’ve been in science: CRISPR and\nPCR,” says John Schimenti, a geneticist at Cornell University in Ithaca,\nNew York. Like PCR, the gene-amplification method that revolutionized\ngenetic engineering after its invention in 1985, “CRISPR is impacting the\nlife sciences in so many ways,” he says.\nBut although CRISPR has much to offer, some scientists are worried\n\n[Image...ILLUSTRATIONS BY SÉBASTIEN THIBAULT\n20 | NATURE | VOL 522 | 4 JUNE 2015\n© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved]\n\n\nthat the field’s breakneck pace leaves little time for addressing the ethical\nand safety concerns such experiments can raise. The problem was\nthrust into the spotlight in April, when news broke that scientists had used\nCRISPR to engineer human embryos (see Nature 520, 593–595; 2015).\nThe embryos they used were unable to result in a live birth, but the report2\nhas generated heated debate over whether and how CRISPR should be\nused to make heritable changes to the human genome. And there are other\nconcerns. Some scientists want to see more studies that probe whether\nthe technique generates stray and potentially risky genome edits; others\nworry that edited organisms could disrupt entire ecosystems. “This power\nis so easily accessible by labs — you don’t need a very expensive piece of\nequipment and people don’t need to get many years of training to do this,”\nsays Stanley Qi, a systems biologist at Stanford University in California.\n“We should think carefully about how we are going to use that power.”\n\nRESEARCH REVOLUTION\nBiologists have long been able to edit genomes with molecular tools.\nAbout ten years ago, they became excited by enzymes called zinc finger\nnucleases that promised to do this accurately and efficiently. But zinc\nfingers, which cost US$5,000 or more to order, were not widely adopted\nbecause they are difficult to engineer and expensive, says James Haber, a\nmolecular biologist at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts.\nCRISPR works differently: it relies on an enzyme called Cas9 that uses a\nguide RNA molecule to home in on its target DNA, then edits the DNA\nto disrupt genes or insert desired sequences. Researchers often need to\norder only the RNA fragment; the other components can be bought off\nthe shelf. Total cost: as little as $30. “That effectively democratized the\ntechnology so that everyone is using it,” says Haber. “It’s a huge revolution.”\nCRISPR methodology is quickly eclipsing zinc finger nucleases and\nother editing tools (see ‘The rise of CRISPR’). For some, that means\nabandoning techniques they had taken years to perfect. “I’m depressed,”\nsays Bill Skarnes, a geneticist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in\nHinxton, UK, “but I’m also excited.” Skarnes had spent much of his career\nusing a technology introduced in the mid-1980s: inserting DNA into\nembryonic stem cells and then using those cells to generate genetically\nmodified mice. The technique became a laboratory workhorse, but it was\nalso time-consuming and costly. CRISPR takes a fraction of the time, and\nSkarnes adopted the technique two years ago.\nResearchers have traditionally relied heavily on model organisms\nsuch as mice and fruit flies, partly because they were the only species\nthat came with a good tool kit for genetic manipulation. Now CRISPR\nis making it possible to edit genes in many more organisms. In April, for\nexample, researchers at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research\nin Cambridge, Massachusetts, reported using CRISPR to study Candida\nalbicans, a fungus that is particularly deadly in people with weakened\nimmune systems, but had been difficult to genetically manipulate in the\nlab3. \n\nJennifer Doudna, a CRISPR pioneer at the University of California,\nBerkeley, is keeping a list of CRISPR-altered creatures. So far, she has three\ndozen entries, including disease-causing parasites called trypanosomes\nand yeasts used to make biofuels.\nYet the rapid progress has its drawbacks. “People just don’t have the\ntime to characterize some of the very basic parameters of the system,”\nsays Bo Huang, a biophysicist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n“There is a mentality that as long as it works, we don’t have to\nunderstand how or why it works.” That means that researchers occasionally\nrun up against glitches. Huang and his lab struggled for two months\nto adapt CRISPR for use in imaging studies. He suspects that the delay\nwould have been shorter had more been known about how to optimize\nthe design of guide RNAs, a basic but important nuance.\nBy and large, researchers see these gaps as a minor price to pay for a\npowerful technique. But Doudna has begun to have more serious concerns\nabout safety.\n\nHer worries began at ameeting in 2014, whenshe saw a postdoc present\nwork in which a virus was engineered to carry the CRISPR components into mice. The\nmice breathed in the virus, allowing the CRISPR system to engineer mutations\nand create a model for human lung cancer4. \n\nDoudna got a chill; a\nminor mistake in the design of the guide RNA could result in a CRISPR\nthat worked in human lungs as well. “It seemed incredibly scary that you\nmight have students who were working with such a thing,” she says. “It’s\nimportant for people to appreciate what this technology can do.”\nAndrea Ventura, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering\nCancer Center in New York and a lead author of the work, says that his\nlab carefully considered the safety implications: the guide sequences were\ndesigned to target genome regions that were unique to mice, and the virus\nwas disabled such that it could not replicate. He agrees that it is important\nto anticipate even remote risks. “The guides are not designed to cut the\nhuman genome, but you never know,” he says. “It’s not very likely, but it\nstill needs to be considered.”\n\nEDITING OUT DISEASE\nLast year, bioengineer Daniel Anderson of the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology in Cambridge and his colleagues used CRISPR in mice to correct\na mutation associated with a human metabolic disease called tyrosinaemia5\n. It was the first use of CRISPR to fix a disease-causing mutation\nin an adult animal — and an important step towards using the technology\nfor gene therapy in humans.\n\nThe idea that CRISPR could accelerate the gene-therapy field is a\nmajor source of excitement in scientific and biotechnology circles. But as\nwell as highlighting the potential, Anderson’s study showed how far there\nis to go. To deliver the Cas9 enzyme and its guide RNA into the target\norgan, the liver, the team had to pump large volumes of liquid into blood\nvessels — something that is not generally considered feasible in people.\nAnd the experiments corrected the disease-causing mutation in just 0.4%\nof the cells, which is not enough to have an impact on many diseases.\nOver the past two years, a handful of companies have sprung up to\ndevelop CRISPR-based gene therapy, and Anderson and others say that\nthe first clinical trials of such a treatment could happen in the next one\nor two years. Those first trials will probably be scenarios in which the\nCRISPR components can be injected directly into tissues, such as those\nin the eye, or in which cells can be removed from the body, engineered in\nthe lab and then put back. For example, blood-forming stem cells might be\ncorrected to treat conditions such as sickle-cell disease or β-thalassaemia.\nIt will be a bigger challenge to deliver the enzyme and guide RNA into\nmany other tissues, but researchers hope that the technique could one day\nbe used to tackle a wider range of genetic diseases.\nYet many scientists caution that there is much to do before CRISPR\ncan be deployed safely and efficiently. Scientists need to increase the\nefficiency of editing, but at the same time make sure that they do not\nintroduce changes elsewhere in the genome that have consequences for\nhealth. “These enzymes will cut in places other than the places you have\ndesigned them to cut, and that has lots of implications,” says Haber. “If\nyou’re going to replace somebody’s sickle-cell gene in a stem cell, you’re\ngoing to be asked, ‘Well, what other damage might you have done at other\nsites in the genome?’”\n\nKeith Joung, who studies gene editing at Massachusetts General Hospital\nin Boston, has been developing methods to hunt down Cas9’s off-target\ncuts. He says that the frequency of such cuts varies widely from cell to\ncell and from one sequence to another: his lab and others have seen offtarget\nsites with mutation frequencies ranging from 0.1% to more than\n60%. Even low-frequency events could potentially be dangerous if they\naccelerate a cell’s growth and lead to cancer, he says.\nWith so many unanswered questions, it is important to keep\nexpectations of CRISPR under control, says Katrine Bosley, chief executive\nof Editas, a company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that is pursuing\nCRISPR-mediated gene therapy. Bosley is a veteran of commercializing\nnew technologies, and says that usually the hard part is convincing others\nthat an approach will work. “With CRISPR it’s almost the opposite,” she\nsays. “There’s so much excitement and support, but we have to be realistic\nabout what it takes to get there.”\n\nCRISPR ON THE FARM\n\nWhile Anderson and others are aiming to modify DNA in human cells,\nothers are targeting crops and livestock. Before the arrival of geneediting\ntechniques, this was generally done by inserting a gene into\nthe genome at random positions, along with sequences from bacteria,\nviruses or other species that drive expression of the gene. But the process\nis inefficient, and it has always been fodder for critics who dislike\nthe mixing of DNA from different species or worry that the insertion\ncould interrupt other genes. What is more, getting genetically modified\ncrops approved for use is so complex and expensive that most of\nthose that have been modified are large commodity crops such as maize\n(corn) and soya beans.\n\nWith CRISPR, the situation could change: the ease and low cost may\nmake genome editing a viable option for smaller, speciality crops, as\nwell as animals.In the past few years, researchers have used the method\nto engineer petite pigs and to make disease-resistant wheat and rice.\nThey have also made progress towards engineering dehorned cattle,\ndisease-resistant goats and vitamin-enriched sweet oranges. Doudna\nanticipates that her list of CRISPR-modified organisms will grow.\n“There’s an interesting opportunity to consider doing experiments or\nengineering pathways in plants that are not as important commercially\nbut are very interesting from a research perspective — or for home\nvegetable gardens,” she says.\nCRISPR’s ability to precisely edit existing DNA sequences makes\nfor more-accurate modifications, but it also makes it more difficult\nfor regulators and farmers to identify a modified organism once it\nhas been released. “With gene editing, there’s no longer the ability to\nreally track engineered products,” says Jennifer Kuzma, who studies\nscience policy at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. “It will\nbe hard to detect whether something has been mutated conventionally\nor genetically engineered.”\n\nThat rings alarm bells for opponents of genetically modified crops,\nand it poses difficult questions for countries trying to work out how to\nregulate gene-edited plants and animals. In the United States, the Food\nand Drug Administration has yet to approve any genetically modified\nanimal for human consumption, and it has not yet announced how it\nwill handle gene-edited animals.\nUnder existing rules, not all crops made by genome editing would\nrequire regulation by the US Department of Agriculture (see Nature\n500, 389–390; 2013). But in May, the agriculture department began\nto seek input on how it can improve regulation of genetically modified\ncrops — a move that many have taken as a sign that the agency is\nre-evaluating its rules in light of technologies such as CRISPR. “The\nwindow has been cracked,” says Kuzma. “What goes through the window\nremains to be seen. But the fact that it’s even been cracked is\npretty exciting.”\n\nENGINEERED ECOSYSTEMS\nBeyond the farm, researchers are considering how CRISPR could or\nshould be deployed on organisms in the wild. Much of the attention\nhas focused on a method called gene drive, which can quickly sweep\nan edited gene through a population. The work is at an early stage, but\nsuch a technique could be used to wipe out disease-carrying mosquitoes\nor ticks, eliminate invasive plants or eradicate herbicide resistance in\npigweed, which plagues some US farmers.\n\nUsually, a genetic change in one organism takes a long time to spread\nthrough a population. That is because a mutation carried on one of a\npair of chromosomes is inherited by only half the offspring. But a gene\ndrive allows a mutation made by CRISPR on one chromosome to copy\nitself to its partner in every generation, so that nearly all offspring will\ninherit the change. This means that it will speed through a population\nexponentially faster than normal (see ‘Gene drive’) — a mutation\nengineered into a mosquito could spread through a large population\nwithin a season. If that mutation reduced the number of offspring a\nmosquito produced, then the population could be wiped out, along with\nany malaria parasites it is carrying.\n\nBut many researchers are deeply worried that altering an entire\npopulation, or eliminating it altogether, could have drastic and unknown\nconsequences for an ecosystem: it might mean that other pests emerge,\nfor example, or it could affect predators higher up the food chain.

This mutation could\nthen race through the population, with unpredictable effects.\n“It has to have a fairly high pay-off, because it has a risk of irreversibility\n— and unintended or hard-to-calculate consequences for\nother species,” says George Church, a bioengineer at Harvard Medical\nSchool in Boston. In April 2014, Church and a team of scientists and\npolicy experts wrote a commentary in Science6\n warning researchers\nabout the risks and proposing ways to guard against accidental release\nof experimental gene drives.\nAt the time, gene drives seemed a distant prospect. But less than\na year later, developmental biologist Ethan Bier of the University of\nCalifornia, San Diego, and his student Valentino Gantz reported that\nthey had designed just such a system in fruit flies7\n. Bier and Gantz had\nused three layers of boxes to contain their flies and adopted lab safety\nmeasures usually used for malaria-carrying mosquitoes. But they did\nnot follow all the guidelines urged by the authors of the commentary,\nsuch as devising a method to reverse the engineered change. Bier says\nthat they were conducting their first proof-of-principle experiments,\nand wanted to know whether the system worked at all before they\nmade it more complex.\n\nFor Church and others, this was a clear warning that the democratization\nof genome editing through CRISPR could have unexpected and\nundesirable outcomes. “It is essential that national regulatory authorities\nand international organizations get on top of this — really get on\ntop of it,” says Kenneth Oye, a political scientist at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology and lead author of the Science commentary.\n“We need more action.” The US National Research Council has formed\na panel to discuss gene drives, and other high-level discussions are\nstarting to take place. But Oye is concerned that the science is moving\nat lightning speed, and that regulatory changes may happen only after\na high-profile gene-drive release.\n\nThe issue is not black and white. Micky Eubanks, an insect ecologist\nat Texas A&M University in College Station, says that the idea of gene\ndrives shocked him at first. “My initial gut reaction was ‘Oh my god, this\nis terrible. It’s so scary’,” he says. “But when you give it more thought and\nweigh it against the environmental changes that we have already made\nand continue to make, it would be a drop in the ocean.”\nSome researchers see lessons for CRISPR in the arc of other new technologies\nthat prompted great excitement, concern and then disappointment\nwhen teething troubles hit. Medical geneticist James Wilson of the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia was at the centre of booming\nenthusiasm over gene therapy in the 1990s — only to witness its downfall\nwhen a clinical trial went wrong and killed a young man. The field\nwent into a tailspin and has only recently begun to recover. The CRISPR\nfield is still young, Wilson says, and it could be years before its potential\nis realized. “It’s in the exploration stage. These ideas need to ferment.”\nThen again, Wilson has been bitten by the CRISPR bug. He says that\nhe was sceptical of all the promises being made about it until his own lab\nbegan to play with the technique. “It’s ultimately going to have a role in\nhuman therapeutics,” he says. “It’s just really spectacular.” ■\nHeidi Ledford is a senior reporter for Nature in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts.\n1.

But with its\nhuge potential come pressing concerns.\n\n\nThree years ago, Bruce Conklin came across a method that made\nhim change the course of his lab.\nConklin, a geneticist at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco,\nCalifornia, had been trying to work out how variations in DNA affect various\nhuman diseases, but his tools were cumbersome. When he worked\nwith cells from patients, it was hard to know which sequences were important\nfor disease and which were just background noise. And engineering a\nmutation into cells was expensive and laborious work. “It was a student’s\nentire thesis to change one gene,” he says.\n\nThen, in 2012, he read about a newly published technique1\n calledCRISPR that would allow researchers to quickly change the DNA of nearly\nany organism — including humans. Soon after, Conklin abandoned his\nprevious approach to modelling disease and adopted this new one. His lab\nis now feverishly altering genes associated with various heart conditions.\n“CRISPR is turning everything on its head,” he says.\nThe sentiment is widely shared: CRISPR is causing a major upheaval\nin biomedical research. Unlike other gene-editing methods, it is cheap,\nquick and easy to use, and it has swept through labs around the world as\na result. Researchers hope to use it to adjust human genes to eliminate diseases,\ncreate hardier plants, wipe out pathogens and much more besides.\n“I’ve seen two huge developments since I’ve been in science: CRISPR and\nPCR,” says John Schimenti, a geneticist at Cornell University in Ithaca,\nNew York. Like PCR, the gene-amplification method that revolutionized\ngenetic engineering after its invention in 1985, “CRISPR is impacting the\nlife sciences in so many ways,” he says.\nBut although CRISPR has much to offer, some scientists are worried\n\n[Image...ILLUSTRATIONS BY SÉBASTIEN THIBAULT\n20 | NATURE | VOL 522 | 4 JUNE 2015\n© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved]\n\n\nthat the field’s breakneck pace leaves little time for addressing the ethical\nand safety concerns such experiments can raise. The problem was\nthrust into the spotlight in April, when news broke that scientists had used\nCRISPR to engineer human embryos (see Nature 520, 593–595; 2015).\nThe embryos they used were unable to result in a live birth, but the report2\nhas generated heated debate over whether and how CRISPR should be\nused to make heritable changes to the human genome. And there are other\nconcerns. Some scientists want to see more studies that probe whether\nthe technique generates stray and potentially risky genome edits; others\nworry that edited organisms could disrupt entire ecosystems. “This power\nis so easily accessible by labs — you don’t need a very expensive piece of\nequipment and people don’t need to get many years of training to do this,”\nsays Stanley Qi, a systems biologist at Stanford University in California.\n“We should think carefully about how we are going to use that power.”\n\nRESEARCH REVOLUTION\nBiologists have long been able to edit genomes with molecular tools.\nAbout ten years ago, they became excited by enzymes called zinc finger\nnucleases that promised to do this accurately and efficiently. But zinc\nfingers, which cost US$5,000 or more to order, were not widely adopted\nbecause they are difficult to engineer and expensive, says James Haber, a\nmolecular biologist at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts.\nCRISPR works differently: it relies on an enzyme called Cas9 that uses a\nguide RNA molecule to home in on its target DNA, then edits the DNA\nto disrupt genes or insert desired sequences. Researchers often need to\norder only the RNA fragment; the other components can be bought off\nthe shelf. Total cost: as little as $30. “That effectively democratized the\ntechnology so that everyone is using it,” says Haber. “It’s a huge revolution.”\nCRISPR methodology is quickly eclipsing zinc finger nucleases and\nother editing tools (see ‘The rise of CRISPR’). For some, that means\nabandoning techniques they had taken years to perfect. “I’m depressed,”\nsays Bill Skarnes, a geneticist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in\nHinxton, UK, “but I’m also excited.” Skarnes had spent much of his career\nusing a technology introduced in the mid-1980s: inserting DNA into\nembryonic stem cells and then using those cells to generate genetically\nmodified mice. The technique became a laboratory workhorse, but it was\nalso time-consuming and costly. CRISPR takes a fraction of the time, and\nSkarnes adopted the technique two years ago.\nResearchers have traditionally relied heavily on model organisms\nsuch as mice and fruit flies, partly because they were the only species\nthat came with a good tool kit for genetic manipulation. Now CRISPR\nis making it possible to edit genes in many more organisms. In April, for\nexample, researchers at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research\nin Cambridge, Massachusetts, reported using CRISPR to study Candida\nalbicans, a fungus that is particularly deadly in people with weakened\nimmune systems, but had been difficult to genetically manipulate in the\nlab3. \n\nJennifer Doudna, a CRISPR pioneer at the University of California,\nBerkeley, is keeping a list of CRISPR-altered creatures. So far, she has three\ndozen entries, including disease-causing parasites called trypanosomes\nand yeasts used to make biofuels.\nYet the rapid progress has its drawbacks. “People just don’t have the\ntime to characterize some of the very basic parameters of the system,”\nsays Bo Huang, a biophysicist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n“There is a mentality that as long as it works, we don’t have to\nunderstand how or why it works.” That means that researchers occasionally\nrun up against glitches. Huang and his lab struggled for two months\nto adapt CRISPR for use in imaging studies. He suspects that the delay\nwould have been shorter had more been known about how to optimize\nthe design of guide RNAs, a basic but important nuance.\nBy and large, researchers see these gaps as a minor price to pay for a\npowerful technique. But Doudna has begun to have more serious concerns\nabout safety.\n\nHer worries began at ameeting in 2014, whenshe saw a postdoc present\nwork in which a virus was engineered to carry the CRISPR components into mice. The\nmice breathed in the virus, allowing the CRISPR system to engineer mutations\nand create a model for human lung cancer4. \n\nDoudna got a chill; a\nminor mistake in the design of the guide RNA could result in a CRISPR\nthat worked in human lungs as well. “It seemed incredibly scary that you\nmight have students who were working with such a thing,” she says. “It’s\nimportant for people to appreciate what this technology can do.”\nAndrea Ventura, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering\nCancer Center in New York and a lead author of the work, says that his\nlab carefully considered the safety implications: the guide sequences were\ndesigned to target genome regions that were unique to mice, and the virus\nwas disabled such that it could not replicate. He agrees that it is important\nto anticipate even remote risks. “The guides are not designed to cut the\nhuman genome, but you never know,” he says. “It’s not very likely, but it\nstill needs to be considered.”\n\nEDITING OUT DISEASE\nLast year, bioengineer Daniel Anderson of the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology in Cambridge and his colleagues used CRISPR in mice to correct\na mutation associated with a human metabolic disease called tyrosinaemia5\n. It was the first use of CRISPR to fix a disease-causing mutation\nin an adult animal — and an important step towards using the technology\nfor gene therapy in humans.\n\nThe idea that CRISPR could accelerate the gene-therapy field is a\nmajor source of excitement in scientific and biotechnology circles. But as\nwell as highlighting the potential, Anderson’s study showed how far there\nis to go. To deliver the Cas9 enzyme and its guide RNA into the target\norgan, the liver, the team had to pump large volumes of liquid into blood\nvessels — something that is not generally considered feasible in people.\nAnd the experiments corrected the disease-causing mutation in just 0.4%\nof the cells, which is not enough to have an impact on many diseases.\nOver the past two years, a handful of companies have sprung up to\ndevelop CRISPR-based gene therapy, and Anderson and others say that\nthe first clinical trials of such a treatment could happen in the next one\nor two years. Those first trials will probably be scenarios in which the\nCRISPR components can be injected directly into tissues, such as those\nin the eye, or in which cells can be removed from the body, engineered in\nthe lab and then put back. For example, blood-forming stem cells might be\ncorrected to treat conditions such as sickle-cell disease or β-thalassaemia.\nIt will be a bigger challenge to deliver the enzyme and guide RNA into\nmany other tissues, but researchers hope that the technique could one day\nbe used to tackle a wider range of genetic diseases.\nYet many scientists caution that there is much to do before CRISPR\ncan be deployed safely and efficiently. Scientists need to increase the\nefficiency of editing, but at the same time make sure that they do not\nintroduce changes elsewhere in the genome that have consequences for\nhealth. “These enzymes will cut in places other than the places you have\ndesigned them to cut, and that has lots of implications,” says Haber. “If\nyou’re going to replace somebody’s sickle-cell gene in a stem cell, you’re\ngoing to be asked, ‘Well, what other damage might you have done at other\nsites in the genome?’”\n\nKeith Joung, who studies gene editing at Massachusetts General Hospital\nin Boston, has been developing methods to hunt down Cas9’s off-target\ncuts. He says that the frequency of such cuts varies widely from cell to\ncell and from one sequence to another: his lab and others have seen offtarget\nsites with mutation frequencies ranging from 0.1% to more than\n60%. Even low-frequency events could potentially be dangerous if they\naccelerate a cell’s growth and lead to cancer, he says.\nWith so many unanswered questions, it is important to keep\nexpectations of CRISPR under control, says Katrine Bosley, chief executive\nof Editas, a company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that is pursuing\nCRISPR-mediated gene therapy. Bosley is a veteran of commercializing\nnew technologies, and says that usually the hard part is convincing others\nthat an approach will work. “With CRISPR it’s almost the opposite,” she\nsays. “There’s so much excitement and support, but we have to be realistic\nabout what it takes to get there.”\n\nCRISPR ON THE FARM\n\nWhile Anderson and others are aiming to modify DNA in human cells,\nothers are targeting crops and livestock. Before the arrival of geneediting\ntechniques, this was generally done by inserting a gene into\nthe genome at random positions, along with sequences from bacteria,\nviruses or other species that drive expression of the gene. But the process\nis inefficient, and it has always been fodder for critics who dislike\nthe mixing of DNA from different species or worry that the insertion\ncould interrupt other genes. What is more, getting genetically modified\ncrops approved for use is so complex and expensive that most of\nthose that have been modified are large commodity crops such as maize\n(corn) and soya beans.\n\nWith CRISPR, the situation could change: the ease and low cost may\nmake genome editing a viable option for smaller, speciality crops, as\nwell as animals.In the past few years, researchers have used the method\nto engineer petite pigs and to make disease-resistant wheat and rice.\nThey have also made progress towards engineering dehorned cattle,\ndisease-resistant goats and vitamin-enriched sweet oranges. Doudna\nanticipates that her list of CRISPR-modified organisms will grow.\n“There’s an interesting opportunity to consider doing experiments or\nengineering pathways in plants that are not as important commercially\nbut are very interesting from a research perspective — or for home\nvegetable gardens,” she says.\nCRISPR’s ability to precisely edit existing DNA sequences makes\nfor more-accurate modifications, but it also makes it more difficult\nfor regulators and farmers to identify a modified organism once it\nhas been released. “With gene editing, there’s no longer the ability to\nreally track engineered products,” says Jennifer Kuzma, who studies\nscience policy at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. “It will\nbe hard to detect whether something has been mutated conventionally\nor genetically engineered.”\n\nThat rings alarm bells for opponents of genetically modified crops,\nand it poses difficult questions for countries trying to work out how to\nregulate gene-edited plants and animals. In the United States, the Food\nand Drug Administration has yet to approve any genetically modified\nanimal for human consumption, and it has not yet announced how it\nwill handle gene-edited animals.\nUnder existing rules, not all crops made by genome editing would\nrequire regulation by the US Department of Agriculture (see Nature\n500, 389–390; 2013). But in May, the agriculture department began\nto seek input on how it can improve regulation of genetically modified\ncrops — a move that many have taken as a sign that the agency is\nre-evaluating its rules in light of technologies such as CRISPR. “The\nwindow has been cracked,” says Kuzma. “What goes through the window\nremains to be seen. But the fact that it’s even been cracked is\npretty exciting.”\n\nENGINEERED ECOSYSTEMS\nBeyond the farm, researchers are considering how CRISPR could or\nshould be deployed on organisms in the wild. Much of the attention\nhas focused on a method called gene drive, which can quickly sweep\nan edited gene through a population. The work is at an early stage, but\nsuch a technique could be used to wipe out disease-carrying mosquitoes\nor ticks, eliminate invasive plants or eradicate herbicide resistance in\npigweed, which plagues some US farmers.\n\nUsually, a genetic change in one organism takes a long time to spread\nthrough a population. That is because a mutation carried on one of a\npair of chromosomes is inherited by only half the offspring. But a gene\ndrive allows a mutation made by CRISPR on one chromosome to copy\nitself to its partner in every generation, so that nearly all offspring will\ninherit the change. This means that it will speed through a population\nexponentially faster than normal (see ‘Gene drive’) — a mutation\nengineered into a mosquito could spread through a large population\nwithin a season. If that mutation reduced the number of offspring a\nmosquito produced, then the population could be wiped out, along with\nany malaria parasites it is carrying.\n\nBut many researchers are deeply worried that altering an entire\npopulation, or eliminating it altogether, could have drastic and unknown\nconsequences for an ecosystem: it might mean that other pests emerge,\nfor example, or it could affect predators higher up the food chain. And\n “It will be hard to\ndetect whether\nsomething has\nbeen mutated\nconventionally\nor genetically\nengineered.”\n\nTHE RISE OF CRISPR\nDNA sequences called CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic\nrepeats) are part of a bacterial defence system.

Bier says\nthat they were conducting their first proof-of-principle experiments,\nand wanted to know whether the system worked at all before they\nmade it more complex.\n\nFor Church and others, this was a clear warning that the democratization\nof genome editing through CRISPR could have unexpected and\nundesirable outcomes. “It is essential that national regulatory authorities\nand international organizations get on top of this — really get on\ntop of it,” says Kenneth Oye, a political scientist at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology and lead author of the Science commentary.\n“We need more action.” The US National Research Council has formed\na panel to discuss gene drives, and other high-level discussions are\nstarting to take place. But Oye is concerned that the science is moving\nat lightning speed, and that regulatory changes may happen only after\na high-profile gene-drive release.\n\nThe issue is not black and white. Micky Eubanks, an insect ecologist\nat Texas A&M University in College Station, says that the idea of gene\ndrives shocked him at first. “My initial gut reaction was ‘Oh my god, this\nis terrible. It’s so scary’,” he says. “But when you give it more thought and\nweigh it against the environmental changes that we have already made\nand continue to make, it would be a drop in the ocean.”\nSome researchers see lessons for CRISPR in the arc of other new technologies\nthat prompted great excitement, concern and then disappointment\nwhen teething troubles hit. Medical geneticist James Wilson of the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia was at the centre of booming\nenthusiasm over gene therapy in the 1990s — only to witness its downfall\nwhen a clinical trial went wrong and killed a young man.

The CRISPR\nfield is still young, Wilson says, and it could be years before its potential\nis realized. “It’s in the exploration stage.

He says that\nhe was sceptical of all the promises being made about it until his own lab\nbegan to play with the technique. “It’s ultimately going to have a role in\nhuman therapeutics,” he says. “It’s just really spectacular.” ■\nHeidi Ledford is a senior reporter for Nature in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts.\n1.

But with its\nhuge potential come pressing concerns.\n\n\nThree years ago, Bruce Conklin came across a method that made\nhim change the course of his lab.\nConklin, a geneticist at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco,\nCalifornia, had been trying to work out how variations in DNA affect various\nhuman diseases, but his tools were cumbersome. When he worked\nwith cells from patients, it was hard to know which sequences were important\nfor disease and which were just background noise. And engineering a\nmutation into cells was expensive and laborious work. “It was a student’s\nentire thesis to change one gene,” he says.\n\nThen, in 2012, he read about a newly published technique1\n calledCRISPR that would allow researchers to quickly change the DNA of nearly\nany organism — including humans. Soon after, Conklin abandoned his\nprevious approach to modelling disease and adopted this new one. His lab\nis now feverishly altering genes associated with various heart conditions.\n“CRISPR is turning everything on its head,” he says.\nThe sentiment is widely shared: CRISPR is causing a major upheaval\nin biomedical research. Unlike other gene-editing methods, it is cheap,\nquick and easy to use, and it has swept through labs around the world as\na result. Researchers hope to use it to adjust human genes to eliminate diseases,\ncreate hardier plants, wipe out pathogens and much more besides.\n“I’ve seen two huge developments since I’ve been in science: CRISPR and\nPCR,” says John Schimenti, a geneticist at Cornell University in Ithaca,\nNew York. Like PCR, the gene-amplification method that revolutionized\ngenetic engineering after its invention in 1985, “CRISPR is impacting the\nlife sciences in so many ways,” he says.\nBut although CRISPR has much to offer, some scientists are worried\n\n[Image...ILLUSTRATIONS BY SÉBASTIEN THIBAULT\n20 | NATURE | VOL 522 | 4 JUNE 2015\n© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved]\n\n\nthat the field’s breakneck pace leaves little time for addressing the ethical\nand safety concerns such experiments can raise. The problem was\nthrust into the spotlight in April, when news broke that scientists had used\nCRISPR to engineer human embryos (see Nature 520, 593–595; 2015).\nThe embryos they used were unable to result in a live birth, but the report2\nhas generated heated debate over whether and how CRISPR should be\nused to make heritable changes to the human genome. And there are other\nconcerns. Some scientists want to see more studies that probe whether\nthe technique generates stray and potentially risky genome edits; others\nworry that edited organisms could disrupt entire ecosystems. “This power\nis so easily accessible by labs — you don’t need a very expensive piece of\nequipment and people don’t need to get many years of training to do this,”\nsays Stanley Qi, a systems biologist at Stanford University in California.\n“We should think carefully about how we are going to use that power.”\n\nRESEARCH REVOLUTION\nBiologists have long been able to edit genomes with molecular tools.\nAbout ten years ago, they became excited by enzymes called zinc finger\nnucleases that promised to do this accurately and efficiently. But zinc\nfingers, which cost US$5,000 or more to order, were not widely adopted\nbecause they are difficult to engineer and expensive, says James Haber, a\nmolecular biologist at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts.\nCRISPR works differently: it relies on an enzyme called Cas9 that uses a\nguide RNA molecule to home in on its target DNA, then edits the DNA\nto disrupt genes or insert desired sequences. Researchers often need to\norder only the RNA fragment; the other components can be bought off\nthe shelf. Total cost: as little as $30. “That effectively democratized the\ntechnology so that everyone is using it,” says Haber. “It’s a huge revolution.”\nCRISPR methodology is quickly eclipsing zinc finger nucleases and\nother editing tools (see ‘The rise of CRISPR’). For some, that means\nabandoning techniques they had taken years to perfect. “I’m depressed,”\nsays Bill Skarnes, a geneticist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in\nHinxton, UK, “but I’m also excited.” Skarnes had spent much of his career\nusing a technology introduced in the mid-1980s: inserting DNA into\nembryonic stem cells and then using those cells to generate genetically\nmodified mice. The technique became a laboratory workhorse, but it was\nalso time-consuming and costly. CRISPR takes a fraction of the time, and\nSkarnes adopted the technique two years ago.\nResearchers have traditionally relied heavily on model organisms\nsuch as mice and fruit flies, partly because they were the only species\nthat came with a good tool kit for genetic manipulation. Now CRISPR\nis making it possible to edit genes in many more organisms. In April, for\nexample, researchers at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research\nin Cambridge, Massachusetts, reported using CRISPR to study Candida\nalbicans, a fungus that is particularly deadly in people with weakened\nimmune systems, but had been difficult to genetically manipulate in the\nlab3. \n\nJennifer Doudna, a CRISPR pioneer at the University of California,\nBerkeley, is keeping a list of CRISPR-altered creatures. So far, she has three\ndozen entries, including disease-causing parasites called trypanosomes\nand yeasts used to make biofuels.\nYet the rapid progress has its drawbacks. “People just don’t have the\ntime to characterize some of the very basic parameters of the system,”\nsays Bo Huang, a biophysicist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n“There is a mentality that as long as it works, we don’t have to\nunderstand how or why it works.” That means that researchers occasionally\nrun up against glitches. Huang and his lab struggled for two months\nto adapt CRISPR for use in imaging studies. He suspects that the delay\nwould have been shorter had more been known about how to optimize\nthe design of guide RNAs, a basic but important nuance.\nBy and large, researchers see these gaps as a minor price to pay for a\npowerful technique. But Doudna has begun to have more serious concerns\nabout safety.\n\nHer worries began at ameeting in 2014, whenshe saw a postdoc present\nwork in which a virus was engineered to carry the CRISPR components into mice. The\nmice breathed in the virus, allowing the CRISPR system to engineer mutations\nand create a model for human lung cancer4. \n\nDoudna got a chill; a\nminor mistake in the design of the guide RNA could result in a CRISPR\nthat worked in human lungs as well. “It seemed incredibly scary that you\nmight have students who were working with such a thing,” she says. “It’s\nimportant for people to appreciate what this technology can do.”\nAndrea Ventura, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering\nCancer Center in New York and a lead author of the work, says that his\nlab carefully considered the safety implications: the guide sequences were\ndesigned to target genome regions that were unique to mice, and the virus\nwas disabled such that it could not replicate. He agrees that it is important\nto anticipate even remote risks. “The guides are not designed to cut the\nhuman genome, but you never know,” he says. “It’s not very likely, but it\nstill needs to be considered.”\n\nEDITING OUT DISEASE\nLast year, bioengineer Daniel Anderson of the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology in Cambridge and his colleagues used CRISPR in mice to correct\na mutation associated with a human metabolic disease called tyrosinaemia5\n. It was the first use of CRISPR to fix a disease-causing mutation\nin an adult animal — and an important step towards using the technology\nfor gene therapy in humans.\n\nThe idea that CRISPR could accelerate the gene-therapy field is a\nmajor source of excitement in scientific and biotechnology circles. But as\nwell as highlighting the potential, Anderson’s study showed how far there\nis to go. To deliver the Cas9 enzyme and its guide RNA into the target\norgan, the liver, the team had to pump large volumes of liquid into blood\nvessels — something that is not generally considered feasible in people.\nAnd the experiments corrected the disease-causing mutation in just 0.4%\nof the cells, which is not enough to have an impact on many diseases.\nOver the past two years, a handful of companies have sprung up to\ndevelop CRISPR-based gene therapy, and Anderson and others say that\nthe first clinical trials of such a treatment could happen in the next one\nor two years. Those first trials will probably be scenarios in which the\nCRISPR components can be injected directly into tissues, such as those\nin the eye, or in which cells can be removed from the body, engineered in\nthe lab and then put back. For example, blood-forming stem cells might be\ncorrected to treat conditions such as sickle-cell disease or β-thalassaemia.\nIt will be a bigger challenge to deliver the enzyme and guide RNA into\nmany other tissues, but researchers hope that the technique could one day\nbe used to tackle a wider range of genetic diseases.\nYet many scientists caution that there is much to do before CRISPR\ncan be deployed safely and efficiently. Scientists need to increase the\nefficiency of editing, but at the same time make sure that they do not\nintroduce changes elsewhere in the genome that have consequences for\nhealth. “These enzymes will cut in places other than the places you have\ndesigned them to cut, and that has lots of implications,” says Haber. “If\nyou’re going to replace somebody’s sickle-cell gene in a stem cell, you’re\ngoing to be asked, ‘Well, what other damage might you have done at other\nsites in the genome?’”\n\nKeith Joung, who studies gene editing at Massachusetts General Hospital\nin Boston, has been developing methods to hunt down Cas9’s off-target\ncuts. He says that the frequency of such cuts varies widely from cell to\ncell and from one sequence to another: his lab and others have seen offtarget\nsites with mutation frequencies ranging from 0.1% to more than\n60%. Even low-frequency events could potentially be dangerous if they\naccelerate a cell’s growth and lead to cancer, he says.\nWith so many unanswered questions, it is important to keep\nexpectations of CRISPR under control, says Katrine Bosley, chief executive\nof Editas, a company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that is pursuing\nCRISPR-mediated gene therapy. Bosley is a veteran of commercializing\nnew technologies, and says that usually the hard part is convincing others\nthat an approach will work. “With CRISPR it’s almost the opposite,” she\nsays. “There’s so much excitement and support, but we have to be realistic\nabout what it takes to get there.”\n\nCRISPR ON THE FARM\n\nWhile Anderson and others are aiming to modify DNA in human cells,\nothers are targeting crops and livestock. Before the arrival of geneediting\ntechniques, this was generally done by inserting a gene into\nthe genome at random positions, along with sequences from bacteria,\nviruses or other species that drive expression of the gene. But the process\nis inefficient, and it has always been fodder for critics who dislike\nthe mixing of DNA from different species or worry that the insertion\ncould interrupt other genes. What is more, getting genetically modified\ncrops approved for use is so complex and expensive that most of\nthose that have been modified are large commodity crops such as maize\n(corn) and soya beans.\n\nWith CRISPR, the situation could change: the ease and low cost may\nmake genome editing a viable option for smaller, speciality crops, as\nwell as animals.In the past few years, researchers have used the method\nto engineer petite pigs and to make disease-resistant wheat and rice.\nThey have also made progress towards engineering dehorned cattle,\ndisease-resistant goats and vitamin-enriched sweet oranges. Doudna\nanticipates that her list of CRISPR-modified organisms will grow.\n“There’s an interesting opportunity to consider doing experiments or\nengineering pathways in plants that are not as important commercially\nbut are very interesting from a research perspective — or for home\nvegetable gardens,” she says.\nCRISPR’s ability to precisely edit existing DNA sequences makes\nfor more-accurate modifications, but it also makes it more difficult\nfor regulators and farmers to identify a modified organism once it\nhas been released. “With gene editing, there’s no longer the ability to\nreally track engineered products,” says Jennifer Kuzma, who studies\nscience policy at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. “It will\nbe hard to detect whether something has been mutated conventionally\nor genetically engineered.”\n\nThat rings alarm bells for opponents of genetically modified crops,\nand it poses difficult questions for countries trying to work out how to\nregulate gene-edited plants and animals. In the United States, the Food\nand Drug Administration has yet to approve any genetically modified\nanimal for human consumption, and it has not yet announced how it\nwill handle gene-edited animals.\nUnder existing rules, not all crops made by genome editing would\nrequire regulation by the US Department of Agriculture (see Nature\n500, 389–390; 2013). But in May, the agriculture department began\nto seek input on how it can improve regulation of genetically modified\ncrops — a move that many have taken as a sign that the agency is\nre-evaluating its rules in light of technologies such as CRISPR. “The\nwindow has been cracked,” says Kuzma. “What goes through the window\nremains to be seen. But the fact that it’s even been cracked is\npretty exciting.”\n\nENGINEERED ECOSYSTEMS\nBeyond the farm, researchers are considering how CRISPR could or\nshould be deployed on organisms in the wild. Much of the attention\nhas focused on a method called gene drive, which can quickly sweep\nan edited gene through a population. The work is at an early stage, but\nsuch a technique could be used to wipe out disease-carrying mosquitoes\nor ticks, eliminate invasive plants or eradicate herbicide resistance in\npigweed, which plagues some US farmers.\n\nUsually, a genetic change in one organism takes a long time to spread\nthrough a population. That is because a mutation carried on one of a\npair of chromosomes is inherited by only half the offspring. But a gene\ndrive allows a mutation made by CRISPR on one chromosome to copy\nitself to its partner in every generation, so that nearly all offspring will\ninherit the change. This means that it will speed through a population\nexponentially faster than normal (see ‘Gene drive’) — a mutation\nengineered into a mosquito could spread through a large population\nwithin a season. If that mutation reduced the number of offspring a\nmosquito produced, then the population could be wiped out, along with\nany malaria parasites it is carrying.\n\nBut many researchers are deeply worried that altering an entire\npopulation, or eliminating it altogether, could have drastic and unknown\nconsequences for an ecosystem: it might mean that other pests emerge,\nfor example, or it could affect predators higher up the food chain. And\n “It will be hard to\ndetect whether\nsomething has\nbeen mutated\nconventionally\nor genetically\nengineered.”\n\nTHE RISE OF CRISPR\nDNA sequences called CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic\nrepeats) are part of a bacterial defence system. After researchers showed in 2012\nthat CRISPRs could be used to edit genomes, use of the tools quickly spread, as\nre\u001fected by sharp rises in publications, patent applications and funding.\nThe number of papers about CRISPR has outstripped the numbers mentioning\nthe gene-editing technologies known as TALENs and zinc \u001engers.\n\nPUBLICATIONS\nIn 2014, worldwide patent applications that mention\nCRISPR leapt and a patent battle intensi\u001eed.\nPATENTS\nA sharp jump in US National Institutes of Health funding for\nprojects involving CRISPR is a harbinger of future advances.\nDESIGN BY WES FERNANDES;\nSOURCES: PUBLICATIONS:\nSCOPUS; PATENTS: THE LENS;\nFUNDING: NIH REPORTER.\nFUNDING\n2006 2008 2010 2012 2014\n2008 2010 2012 2014\n50\n100\n150\n200\nPublished patent applications Number of publications\nCRISPR\nTALENs\nZinc\n\u001fngers\niPS\ncells\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\n2007 2009 2011 2013\n2007 2009 2011 2013\n2014\nSpending (US$ millions)\nKey events in the\nCRISPR story.\nA BRIEF\nHISTORY\nOF CRISPR\nDecember 1987\nResearchers \u001end\nCRISPR sequences\nin Escherichia coli,\nbut do not characterize\ntheir function8.\nJuly 1995\nCRISPR sequences are\nfound to be common in\nother microbes9.\nMarch 2007\nScientists at food\ncompany Danisco\ndetermine that the\nrepeats are part of a\nbacterial defence\nagainst viruses10.\nOctober 2011\nCARIBOU BIOSCIENCES\nBerkeley, California\nFocus: Research, industry,\ntherapeutics, agriculture\nRaised:\n$11\nMILLION\nJune 2012\nResearchers report\nthat CRISPR can be\nused to perform\ngenome editing1.\nMarch 2013\nThe University of\nCalifornia and others\n\u001ele for a patent on\nthe \u001endings1.\nJanuary 2013\nCRISPR is used in\nmouse and human cells,\nfuelling rapid uptake of\nthe technique by\nresearchers11–13.\nNovember 2013\nEDITAS MEDICINE\nCambridge, Massachusetts\nFocus: Therapeutics\nRaised:\n$43 MILLION\nApril 2014\nMIT and the Broad\nInstitute are granted a\npatent on CRISPR gene\nediting, sparking a\n\u001eerce patent battle.\nNovember 2013\nCRISPR THERAPEUTICS\nBasel, Switzerland\nFocus: Therapeutics\nRaised:\n$89 MILLION\nNovember 2014\nINTELLIA THERAPEUTICS\nCambridge, MA\nFocus: Therapeutics\nRaised:\n$15\nMILLION\nMarch 2015\nReport of the \u001erst\nCRISPR gene drive,\nwhich can spread an\nedited gene rapidly\nthrough a population6.\nApril 2015\nResearchers report\nthat they have edited\nhuman embryos with\nCRISPR, triggering an\nethical debate2.\nCRISPR funding in\n2014 lagged behind\nthe nearly $160 million\nfor iPS-cell research.\nTOP 5 PATENT APPLICANTS:\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT): 62\nBroad Institute: 57\nMIT bioengineer Feng Zhang: 34\nDanisco: 29\nDow Agrosciences: 28\nPapers mentioning\ninduced pluripotent stem\n(iPS) cells, another rapidly\nadopted technique, are\nshown for comparison.\n0\n0\n400\n800\n1,200\n1,600\nA cluster of biotech\ncompanies has\nsprung up to use\nCRISPR technology.\n2006\nUPDATED ON 8 JUNE 2015 | 4 JUNE 2015 | VOL 522 | NATURE | 23 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This mutation could\nthen race through the population, with unpredictable effects.\n“It has to have a fairly high pay-off, because it has a risk of irreversibility\n— and unintended or hard-to-calculate consequences for\nother species,” says George Church, a bioengineer at Harvard Medical\nSchool in Boston. In April 2014, Church and a team of scientists and\npolicy experts wrote a commentary in Science6\n warning researchers\nabout the risks and proposing ways to guard against accidental release\nof experimental gene drives.\nAt the time, gene drives seemed a distant prospect. But less than\na year later, developmental biologist Ethan Bier of the University of\nCalifornia, San Diego, and his student Valentino Gantz reported that\nthey had designed just such a system in fruit flies7\n. Bier and Gantz had\nused three layers of boxes to contain their flies and adopted lab safety\nmeasures usually used for malaria-carrying mosquitoes. But they did\nnot follow all the guidelines urged by the authors of the commentary,\nsuch as devising a method to reverse the engineered change.

And he’s passing along his “dying art” to a new generation of troublemakers.\n\nAUTHOR: Tom Redmond\nDATE: February 9, 2017, 2:00 AM PST\n\nThe roosters start crowing at 4 a.m. on Alder Lane Farm, about an hour north of San Francisco on the edge of Sonoma wine country. While horses stir in their stables and chickens begin to roam the 20-acre property, one of the world’s most fearsome short sellers puts on his usual attire—shorts and flip-flops—and makes his way in the dark to the room behind his garage. Six pinball machines, a gigantic flatscreen, and a pingpong table compete for attention. If not for the Bloomberg terminal in the corner, you might assume this was your typical man cave.\n\nBut let’s not dwell on Marc Cohodes’s pastured chickens, or his show-jumping horses, or even his homemade apricot jam that, on special occasions, San Francisco’s Una Pizza Napoletana puts on its pies in lieu of tomato sauce. Some of the most respected people in the investing industry say that, dating back to the 1980s, nobody has had a better nose for sniffing out fraud than the 56-year-old Cohodes. He’s exposed suspect accounting at a number of high-profile companies, including the Belgian speech-­recognition software developer Lernout & Hauspie, which went bankrupt in 2001 after being valued at about $10 billion, and mortgage lender NovaStar Financial, where his efforts earned him a Harvard Business School case study published in 2013.\n\n\nPhotographer: Brian Frank\n“I would not want to be his adversary if I was still a criminal today,” says Sam Antar, who was sentenced to six months of house arrest and 1,200 hours of community service for cooking the books at New York consumer-electronics chain Crazy Eddie in one of the largest securities frauds unearthed in the 1980s. “A character like Marc”—the two crossed paths later in his life when both were focused on detecting fraud—“you stay away from.”\n\nAnd that’s been relatively easy for at least part of the past eight years. In 2008 the hedge fund Cohodes worked at for more than two decades went out of business under controversial circumstances. He maintains that Goldman Sachs, its prime broker, closed it too hastily by making needless margin calls, a claim Goldman disputes. The fallout spurred a bout of what Cohodes likens to post-traumatic stress disorder. “What happened to me would put the average person under,” he says. He retreated to his farm, where he recuperated by spending his days delivering eggs to San Francisco, cheering on the Oakland Raiders, and traveling to see a friend’s rock band, Collective Soul. Besides, the vast majority of stocks were rising because of central bank stimulus, depriving him of ideal opportunities as a short seller.\n\n“Legitimate companies don’t know who the f--- I am. And they don’t care. The bad guys? They know. And they do care”\n\nNow Cohodes is back. His time among the horses and chickens—outside the money management industry—may even have helped him return to the top of his game. Slimmed down and fighting fit, he’s been winning big on a series of short bets against Canadian companies since he made his comeback. Cohodes says he’s been betting against embattled Valeant Pharmaceuticals International since the summer of 2015. Around the same time, he began shorting another debt-laden Canadian drugmaker, Concordia International, which he calls “the poor man’s Valeant.” Both stocks lost most of their value last year.\n\nCohodes says he’s committed to exposing companies that he believes may be ripping off ordinary, unwary investors—“Joe Six-pack,” as he puts it. “Legitimate companies don’t know who the f--- I am. And they don’t care,” Cohodes says. “The bad guys? They know. And they do care.” And he’ll go to great lengths to chase them down: dumpster-diving to find clues of wrongdoing, lambasting enemies on Twitter (where his rambunctious character is on full display), and hotfooting it across Las Vegas to check whether new business offices reported by NovaStar were real. (They weren’t, according to Cohodes; one was a private home, another a massage parlor.) “I’m a pretty driven guy,” he says.\n\nIndeed, press him on his return to the markets, and Cohodes will reveal another reason that brought him back from the wilderness. Short selling—borrowing stock and selling it, hoping to profit by buying it back later at a lower price—is a “dying art,” he fears. Short-biased funds managed only $5.5 billion in assets as of the end of September, a tiny fraction of the roughly $3 trillion the hedge fund industry oversees, according to Hedge Fund Research. The number of short-biased funds had fallen to 18 at that time, from 50 in 2009. Cohodes wants to make sure the “old-school” craft gets passed along to a new generation of people with—he jokes—that “genetic defect” that makes them want to take on all of Wall Street.\n\n\nAs the bounty hunters of the stock market, short sellers have uncovered some major failings over the years. Think Jim Chanos’s role in highlighting the fraud at Enron, or David Einhorn’s call on Lehman Brothers. But the long list of allegations against short sellers is as old as the markets themselves. They spread false rumors to profit when stocks fall, a practice dubbed “short and distort” that has sometimes gotten them into trouble with regulators. They conspire to torpedo share prices in “bear raids.” They destroy good companies and cause people to lose their jobs. They have many natural enemies, including investors betting shares will rise, analysts issuing buy recommendations, and executives whose whole careers are suddenly called into question when short sellers level charges against them. And they’re not regulated the way Wall Street analysts are, so they aren’t as accountable.\n\nTo short a stock and then publicly recommend selling it “absolutely should be illegal,” says Amir Anvarzadeh, head of Japanese equity sales at brokerage BGC Partners in Singapore, stressing he doesn’t know Cohodes and is talking about short selling in general. “It’s morally wrong. It’s called front-running, and it’s wrong.”\n\nAt the same time, the risks short sellers take can be huge. Stocks tend to edge higher naturally, doubling or tripling even when the case against them is justified. That can mean losses for the short seller, not to mention psychological despair. Then there’s the vilification—and the lawsuits, four of which Cohodes has experienced. It’s “just a nasty, difficult, ruthless, bare-knuckled, tough business,” he says. “And no one cuts you any breaks.”\n\nYet there are people who wouldn’t do anything else.\n\nCohodes’s journey to the top ranks of short selling began in Chicago, where he didn’t do well at school—he recalls his ­second-grade teacher worrying he’d end up in jail. He managed to avoid that fate, graduating from Babson College in Massachusetts, where he studied finance. In 1982 he landed a position back in his hometown with Northern Trust, where he met an analyst named Paul Landini who taught him about short selling. The two began visiting a local gaming arcade after work. There, one of Landini’s hunches grew into a conviction as they watched people spend their quarters: Video games would soon usurp pinball machines. They shorted a major pinball company, Bally Manufacturing, and watched with euphoria as the shares lost half their value from the start of 1983 to the end of 1984. Cohodes was hooked.\n\nIn 1985, Cohodes took a job in New York with David Rocker, who’d just started a hedge fund that would come to specialize in short selling. “They were very thorough, swung big, and put together a really nice track record in short selling, which is really hard to do,” says Jeff Ubben, who runs ValueAct Capital Management, an activist fund in San Francisco. Rocker Partners posted a gross annual return of 12 percent from April 1985 to the end of 2007, when shorting the S&P 500 would have produced an 11 percent yearly loss.\n\n“He’s like a terrier. When he gets his jaws on the leg of whatever he’s going after, he can’t let go”\n\nOne of Cohodes’s most famous shorts at Rocker Partners came from a desire to help his son Max, now 30, who was born with cerebral palsy and lives in his own house on the farm. Cohodes thought Lernout & Hauspie’s speech-recognition software might help Max communicate, but he soon found it recognized little of what people said. In the summer of 1998, Rocker Partners started shorting the company, which counted Microsoft as a large shareholder. So began a long campaign of tipping off the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to irregularities in L&H’s books and briefing financial journalists.\n\nThe stock almost tripled in the first three months of 2000, causing several investors to withdraw money from Rocker Partners. Only afterward did the hedge fund get its big break. When L&H started filing detailed quarterly U.S. disclosures following the acquisition of two American companies, Cohodes and others noticed unusually large sales to South Korea, which were largely exposed as fake. In 2001 the company filed for bankruptcy. In 2010 a Belgian court sentenced founders Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie to five-year prison terms, two years of which were suspended. The doggedness with which Cohodes pursued L&H was typical of him, says Jeff Matthews, who worked at Rocker Partners from 1989 to 1993: “He has the biggest balls of anyone I’ve ever known.”\n\n\nBet the jockey, not the horse, Cohodes says. Find executives who once ran companies that performed poorly or were accused of wrongdoing. Look for red flags—serial acquisitions of companies, opaque accounting, overstated numbers. If things don’t add up, don’t stop until you find out why. “He’s like a terrier,” says Herb Greenberg, who co-manages investment analysis company Pacific Square Research. “When he gets his jaws on the leg of whatever he’s going after, he can’t let go.”\n\nCohodes and Rocker Partners’ successes include NovaStar, the subprime lender he sparred with before the financial crisis; it was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2008. Another was AremisSoft, a business-management software provider that artificially inflated revenue. It filed for bankruptcy in 2002, but not before it sued Rocker Partners and others for stock manipulation, a suit it quickly dropped. In 2010, Roys Poyiadjis, the former chief executive officer, was sentenced to probation for a stock fraud that a judge said was “of almost unthinkable magnitude.”\n\nIn the case of AaiPharma—a drugmaker in North Carolina that was delisted, and whose former chief operating officer pleaded guilty in 2005 to fraud conspiracy charges—victory was particularly sweet for Cohodes. He recalls when the company announced in April 2004 that it had received subpoenas from a grand jury seeking testimony and documents concerning its financial reporting. “I just, like, opened the window, and I yelled out at the top of my lungs,” Cohodes says. “This piece of s--- stock was kicking our ass for so long.”\n\nIt was the knock-down, drag-out fight with Utah-based Overstock.com that may have helped sink Rocker Partners. Patrick Byrne, the founder and CEO of the discount retailer, sued the hedge fund in August 2005, claiming it worked with a research firm to manipulate the company’s shares. Byrne suggested that “miscreant hedge funds,” journalists, foreign stock exchanges, and a clearinghouse were among those conspiring to drive down his stock using naked shorting—that is, selling short shares that ­haven’t been borrowed.\n\n“I have a strange affection for Marc as one sometimes develops for an opponent. At the end of the day we sort of put it behind us”\n\nByrne says he was “completely vindicated,” because defendants in lawsuits Overstock brought, including Goldman and Cohodes’s firm, eventually settled. There’s a difference between betting against a horse and “trying to poison” it, he says. Still, “I have a strange affection for Marc as one sometimes develops for an opponent,” Byrne says of Cohodes now. “At the end of the day we sort of put it behind us.”\n\nThe 2005 lawsuit hastened Rocker’s retirement the following year—at least according to Cohodes—and indirectly had a hand in the fund’s demise. As for Rocker and Cohodes, they don’t speak. Cohodes blamed Rocker for unnecessarily riling Byrne, while the argument can be made that the tactics Rocker Partners used against Overstock were no different from those it employed for any other short investment. (Rocker declined to comment for this story.)\n\nWhatever the case, Cohodes was left in control of the company, whose name he changed to Copper River Partners. Then came the financial crisis, which should have been a godsend for a short-­biased fund. “We were having an outstanding year. Outstanding,” Cohodes says. “We were knocking the ball out of the f---ing park.”\n\n\nUntil things started to go wrong.\n\nOn Sept. 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Lehman Brothers International in London, which Copper River used as a prime broker, owed the hedge fund about $100 million at the time, says Phil Renna, who was Copper River’s chief financial officer. Copper River lost access to that money. Days later, in an echo of Byrne’s campaign, the SEC took action against naked short selling. That spurred buying of heavily shorted stocks including Jos. A. Bank Clothiers and Overstock, creating what Cohodes calls “horrific” losses for Copper River. Then the SEC banned short selling of financial companies, which again sent shares the fund was short surging.\n\nAt that point, Goldman stepped in. As Copper River’s main prime broker, it instituted house margin calls, which unlike regulatory margin calls are made at its discretion. Before long, Goldman was liquidating Copper River’s short positions. Goldman blocked Cohodes’s attempt to sell them to another hedge fund, he says. By October the company’s funds were down more than 50 percent. Copper River was unsalvageable. “It’s almost like a bomb blows up near you or near your brain, and it sort of blows your eardrums out, but it doesn’t kill you,” he says.\n\nTestifying in 2011 in connection with a lawsuit Overstock brought against Goldman and others in California, Cohodes said he and his partners speculated that Goldman shut the fund because it hadn’t borrowed shares for Copper River’s short sales and was covering its tracks after the SEC clamped down on naked shorting. He also said he didn’t know for sure. Goldman was removed from the case, which contended that prime brokerages intentionally drove down the price of Overstock’s shares through naked short selling, on the grounds that none of the alleged conduct had taken place in that state. Overstock later said that Goldman had settled a New Jersey action for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) and securities fraud claims following the California rulings. Goldman also agreed to pay fines to the SEC last year and in 2010 for violations of securities lending rules, not related to Copper River, without admitting or denying the allegations either time. “Mr. Cohodes is wrong,” Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said in a statement. “We met our obligations under applicable law,” he said. “Copper River’s problems were the result of the extreme stress in the financial markets at the time.”\nFor his part, Cohodes says Copper River didn’t sue Goldman because nobody had the appetite for a drawn-out legal battle. “I’m a really, really, really good investor, but obviously I was s----y at the investment business, because my fund closed due to what I would call factors beyond my control,” Cohodes says. Even so, he accepts responsibility. “I’m the captain of the ship,” he says. “The ship sank.”\n\n\nPhotographer: Brian Frank\nAlder Lane Farm, which Cohodes kept in a settlement when he got divorced in May 2011, is sprinkled with physical reminders of battles past. They include the pinball machines (thank you, Bally), a Porsche 911 with customized plates that say “Gowex” (a Spanish telecommunications company he bet against), and a 6-year-old Holsteiner horse named Concordia after the drugmaker whose former CEO is suing him. “It showed up the day I got sued—so it just had to be,” he says. He even names some of his roughly 300 chickens after friends and foes. Anyone who doesn’t take the investing game personally is wrong, Cohodes says.\n\nWhich could help explain his time off from investing. “I don’t want to say I took a break from investing, but I sort of took a break from it and just sort of decompressed,” he says of the period following Copper River’s closure. After a couple of years, he began to miss it and started to spend more and more time on short investments. He became a lively presence on Twitter, where he has more than 8,000 followers. He says it’s easier for him to be forthright on social media than it would be if he were still working for a hedge fund, where lawsuits are bad for business.\n\nHe can be forthright elsewhere, too. At a Grant’s Interest Rate Observer investing conference in New York in October, Cohodes shared the stage with some of the biggest names in the industry, including Julian Robertson of Tiger Management fame and bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach. Some people in the audience were taken aback by Cohodes’s “rhetorical style,” as Jim Grant, who organizes the event, puts it. “Marc comes across as kind of an angry and certainly intentionally profane growling bear,” he says. “Beneath that exterior beats the heart of an idealist.”\n\nCohodes himself says his energy for short selling also comes from having a competitive nature that makes him relish the fight—all the more so if he thinks he’s being disrespected, especially by what the straight-talking self-described “scrapper” sees as ­buttoned-up Harvard types. Making money from short selling, he says, isn’t that important to him, although the two Porsches on his farm suggest he’s far from short himself.\n\n\nThis story appears in the February / March 2017 issue of Bloomberg Markets.\nCover artwork: Oriol Angrill Jordà\nWhatever the motivation, most roads for Cohodes these days lead over the U.S. border into the Great White North. When many other short sellers were descending on Valeant, whose stock fell 86 percent last year, he also became interested in the smaller Concordia, which he says is bedecked in red flags. The company’s founder, Mark Thompson, and other executives previously worked for Biovail, which the SEC charged with fraudulent accounting, Cohodes says, recalling his jockey theory. (Biovail agreed to pay $10 million to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations. Thompson, who stepped down as Concordia chairman and CEO in November, wasn’t accused of wrongdoing at Biovail.) Concordia went public through a reverse merger, a process that the SEC says can sometimes lead to fraud and other abuses. It expanded through acquisitions, which short sellers such as Cohodes often see as grounds for suspicion, because they can open the door to accounting tricks. And its business model of buying drugs and jacking up their prices (similar to the strategy that was used by Valeant) is coming under increasing scrutiny. (“Valeant’s new management team is working diligently to earn the confidence of the investment community and deliver on our commitments,” including repaying debt, says company spokesman Scott Hirsch.)\n\nCohodes became convinced Concordia would buckle under the large debts it assumed to fund its acquisitions. Dissecting the company’s accounts, Cohodes noticed that it was recognizing revenue on shipment rather than when products are sold to the consumer and that it had opaque reserves. Those practices are not illegal but have been used by companies in the past to inflate sales in what’s known as channel stuffing.\n\nBefore long, Concordia’s earnings started to miss estimates. Last September, the U.K. government introduced a bill proposing controls on overcharging in the pharmaceutical industry. Debating the bill, members of Parliament said it would close a loophole that allowed companies including Amdipharm Mercury, as Concordia’s biggest purchase was named before Concordia bought it, to acquire off-patent generic drugs with dominant market positions and push up their prices. “When price gouging ends, the channel gets drained and the results just completely suck,” Cohodes says. (Concordia didn’t respond to requests for comment but said in a statement in December that it believes it can service its debt while focusing on developing a new long-term plan.)\n\nConcordia shares plunged 95 percent in 2016, handing Cohodes a huge profit. He also got slapped with a libel and defamation lawsuit from then-CEO Thompson for comments he made on Canadian TV about the executive’s work history. Cohodes traveled to Toronto in January and filed a 494-page motion to contest the suit, which he sees as a standard tactic to silence short sellers. (Peter Downard, Thompson’s lawyer, disagrees: “Don’t be diverted by the suggestion that Mr. Cohodes is being sued for criticizing Concordia. Mr. Cohodes went on television and alleged that Mark engaged in misconduct early in his career, long before he was involved with Concordia.”) Cohodes continues to berate Thompson on Twitter. He says he spent about 2,000 hours researching the company and considers it his best-ever short investment.\n\nSince the fall of 2014, Cohodes has also been shorting another Canadian business, mortgage lender Home Capital Group in Toronto. The company said in 2015 that it suspended 45 brokers for alleged mortgage fraud, and its stock fell by almost half from November 2014 through the end of January. (Home Capital declined to comment for this story, but it said last year that “there have been no unusual credit issues on these mortgages.”)\n\nFor all the good bets, Cohodes says, there have been plenty of bad ones, too. Take Ebix, a U.S. supplier of software to the insurance industry, and Keurig Green Mountain, a specialty coffee maker. Ebix surged more than sixfold from June 2013, and Keurig Green Mountain was taken private at a large premium. Still, Cohodes says his return to short selling has “been blessed” and he’s “had two really good years,” but he declines to give details.\n\nAs well as betting against many companies in Canada, which he sees as a prime hunting ground, Cohodes has appeared frequently in Canadian media since 2015 to expose what he sees as the reason for the bubble in Vancouver real estate. He says the provincial government has ignored or even encouraged illegal money entering the country from China. Cohodes says he’s campaigning on this issue without a profit motive: His Canadian real estate shorts have no exposure to Vancouver, where the price of a typical single-family home surged to C$1.5 million ($1.1 million), about 20 times what the median household earns in a year. In August, British Columbia’s government imposed a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers to address the situation that Cohodes helped highlight. Vancouver home sales plunged 40 percent in January over a year earlier.\n\n\nIn addition to looking after his son and communicating to regulators, investors, and journalists about his short bets, Cohodes makes time to mentor people who share the fraud-sniffing gene and whom he’s identified as bright prospects in the short-­selling business. He speaks with them regularly about their ideas—something he says also benefits him, especially because he no longer has the research and analytical resources of his own fund.\n\nIt’s something he’s always done. Jerome Souza was a batboy for the Oakland A’s before Cohodes took him under his wing, gave him a job at Copper River, and taught him how to be a short seller. After the fund closed, Cohodes was supportive when Souza decided to use the detective skills he learned there to go to work for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Souza says Cohodes is like a dad to him. The Sunday after Thanksgiving, Souza, 32, and his family drove 13 hours from Tucson to have dinner with Cohodes, his second wife, Aurora, 51, and Max.\n\nThen there’s Fahmi Quadir. “I don’t know whether to call him my ideal father or ideal lover,” says Quadir, 26, who started short selling in 2015 at Krensavage Asset Management in New York. Cohodes calls her “the assassin,” because she operates in the shadows and her short research can be devastating. “He’s so passionate about what he does,” she says of Cohodes. “Meeting Marc changed my life and made me realize what it means to be a short seller.”\n\nCohodes says he’ll never go back to managing other people’s money, because his new setup gives him the joys of being a short seller without hassles like meeting investors. “Marc has figured out a way to be in the game without being in the game,” Pacific Square’s Greenberg says.\n\nAt Concordia’s shareholder meeting in April 2016, according to local media reports, then-CEO Thompson said, “If you are a chicken farmer, your chickens will come home to roost.” Cohodes interpreted this as a threat: that he’d get what’s coming to him. Being threatened, Cohodes says, isn’t something he takes kindly to, and when he is he becomes even more determined.\n\nAs for those chickens, sure, Cohodes’s eggs may sell for $13 a dozen at Bi-Rite Market in San Francisco, but he warns Thompson and other targets, present and future, not to under­estimate him. “Yeah, I have chickens, and yeah, I sell eggs in the city, but I spend about 1/32nd of my day doing chicken work,” he says. “I’m happy that he thinks I’m a chicken farmer. But I’m still intensely focused on some stuff. I will knock their heads off.” \n\n—Redmond is Japan markets editor for Bloomberg News in Tokyo.

Think Jim Chanos’s role in highlighting the fraud at Enron, or David Einhorn’s call on Lehman Brothers. But the long list of allegations against short sellers is as old as the markets themselves. They spread false rumors to profit when stocks fall, a practice dubbed “short and distort” that has sometimes gotten them into trouble with regulators. They conspire to torpedo share prices in “bear raids.” They destroy good companies and cause people to lose their jobs. They have many natural enemies, including investors betting shares will rise, analysts issuing buy recommendations, and executives whose whole careers are suddenly called into question when short sellers level charges against them. And they’re not regulated the way Wall Street analysts are, so they aren’t as accountable.\n\nTo short a stock and then publicly recommend selling it “absolutely should be illegal,” says Amir Anvarzadeh, head of Japanese equity sales at brokerage BGC Partners in Singapore, stressing he doesn’t know Cohodes and is talking about short selling in general. “It’s morally wrong. It’s called front-running, and it’s wrong.”\n\nAt the same time, the risks short sellers take can be huge. Stocks tend to edge higher naturally, doubling or tripling even when the case against them is justified. That can mean losses for the short seller, not to mention psychological despair. Then there’s the vilification—and the lawsuits, four of which Cohodes has experienced. It’s “just a nasty, difficult, ruthless, bare-knuckled, tough business,” he says. “And no one cuts you any breaks.”\n\nYet there are people who wouldn’t do anything else.\n\nCohodes’s journey to the top ranks of short selling began in Chicago, where he didn’t do well at school—he recalls his ­second-grade teacher worrying he’d end up in jail. He managed to avoid that fate, graduating from Babson College in Massachusetts, where he studied finance. In 1982 he landed a position back in his hometown with Northern Trust, where he met an analyst named Paul Landini who taught him about short selling. The two began visiting a local gaming arcade after work. There, one of Landini’s hunches grew into a conviction as they watched people spend their quarters: Video games would soon usurp pinball machines. They shorted a major pinball company, Bally Manufacturing, and watched with euphoria as the shares lost half their value from the start of 1983 to the end of 1984. Cohodes was hooked.\n\nIn 1985, Cohodes took a job in New York with David Rocker, who’d just started a hedge fund that would come to specialize in short selling. “They were very thorough, swung big, and put together a really nice track record in short selling, which is really hard to do,” says Jeff Ubben, who runs ValueAct Capital Management, an activist fund in San Francisco. Rocker Partners posted a gross annual return of 12 percent from April 1985 to the end of 2007, when shorting the S&P 500 would have produced an 11 percent yearly loss.\n\n“He’s like a terrier. When he gets his jaws on the leg of whatever he’s going after, he can’t let go”\n\nOne of Cohodes’s most famous shorts at Rocker Partners came from a desire to help his son Max, now 30, who was born with cerebral palsy and lives in his own house on the farm. Cohodes thought Lernout & Hauspie’s speech-recognition software might help Max communicate, but he soon found it recognized little of what people said. In the summer of 1998, Rocker Partners started shorting the company, which counted Microsoft as a large shareholder. So began a long campaign of tipping off the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to irregularities in L&H’s books and briefing financial journalists.\n\nThe stock almost tripled in the first three months of 2000, causing several investors to withdraw money from Rocker Partners. Only afterward did the hedge fund get its big break. When L&H started filing detailed quarterly U.S. disclosures following the acquisition of two American companies, Cohodes and others noticed unusually large sales to South Korea, which were largely exposed as fake. In 2001 the company filed for bankruptcy. In 2010 a Belgian court sentenced founders Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie to five-year prison terms, two years of which were suspended. The doggedness with which Cohodes pursued L&H was typical of him, says Jeff Matthews, who worked at Rocker Partners from 1989 to 1993: “He has the biggest balls of anyone I’ve ever known.”\n\n\nBet the jockey, not the horse, Cohodes says. Find executives who once ran companies that performed poorly or were accused of wrongdoing. Look for red flags—serial acquisitions of companies, opaque accounting, overstated numbers. If things don’t add up, don’t stop until you find out why. “He’s like a terrier,” says Herb Greenberg, who co-manages investment analysis company Pacific Square Research. “When he gets his jaws on the leg of whatever he’s going after, he can’t let go.”\n\nCohodes and Rocker Partners’ successes include NovaStar, the subprime lender he sparred with before the financial crisis; it was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2008. Another was AremisSoft, a business-management software provider that artificially inflated revenue. It filed for bankruptcy in 2002, but not before it sued Rocker Partners and others for stock manipulation, a suit it quickly dropped. In 2010, Roys Poyiadjis, the former chief executive officer, was sentenced to probation for a stock fraud that a judge said was “of almost unthinkable magnitude.”\n\nIn the case of AaiPharma—a drugmaker in North Carolina that was delisted, and whose former chief operating officer pleaded guilty in 2005 to fraud conspiracy charges—victory was particularly sweet for Cohodes. He recalls when the company announced in April 2004 that it had received subpoenas from a grand jury seeking testimony and documents concerning its financial reporting. “I just, like, opened the window, and I yelled out at the top of my lungs,” Cohodes says. “This piece of s--- stock was kicking our ass for so long.”\n\nIt was the knock-down, drag-out fight with Utah-based Overstock.com that may have helped sink Rocker Partners. Patrick Byrne, the founder and CEO of the discount retailer, sued the hedge fund in August 2005, claiming it worked with a research firm to manipulate the company’s shares. Byrne suggested that “miscreant hedge funds,” journalists, foreign stock exchanges, and a clearinghouse were among those conspiring to drive down his stock using naked shorting—that is, selling short shares that ­haven’t been borrowed.\n\n“I have a strange affection for Marc as one sometimes develops for an opponent. At the end of the day we sort of put it behind us”\n\nByrne says he was “completely vindicated,” because defendants in lawsuits Overstock brought, including Goldman and Cohodes’s firm, eventually settled. There’s a difference between betting against a horse and “trying to poison” it, he says. Still, “I have a strange affection for Marc as one sometimes develops for an opponent,” Byrne says of Cohodes now. “At the end of the day we sort of put it behind us.”\n\nThe 2005 lawsuit hastened Rocker’s retirement the following year—at least according to Cohodes—and indirectly had a hand in the fund’s demise. As for Rocker and Cohodes, they don’t speak. Cohodes blamed Rocker for unnecessarily riling Byrne, while the argument can be made that the tactics Rocker Partners used against Overstock were no different from those it employed for any other short investment. (Rocker declined to comment for this story.)\n\nWhatever the case, Cohodes was left in control of the company, whose name he changed to Copper River Partners. Then came the financial crisis, which should have been a godsend for a short-­biased fund. “We were having an outstanding year. Outstanding,” Cohodes says. “We were knocking the ball out of the f---ing park.”\n\n\nUntil things started to go wrong.\n\nOn Sept. 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Lehman Brothers International in London, which Copper River used as a prime broker, owed the hedge fund about $100 million at the time, says Phil Renna, who was Copper River’s chief financial officer. Copper River lost access to that money. Days later, in an echo of Byrne’s campaign, the SEC took action against naked short selling. That spurred buying of heavily shorted stocks including Jos. A. Bank Clothiers and Overstock, creating what Cohodes calls “horrific” losses for Copper River. Then the SEC banned short selling of financial companies, which again sent shares the fund was short surging.\n\nAt that point, Goldman stepped in. As Copper River’s main prime broker, it instituted house margin calls, which unlike regulatory margin calls are made at its discretion. Before long, Goldman was liquidating Copper River’s short positions. Goldman blocked Cohodes’s attempt to sell them to another hedge fund, he says. By October the company’s funds were down more than 50 percent. Copper River was unsalvageable. “It’s almost like a bomb blows up near you or near your brain, and it sort of blows your eardrums out, but it doesn’t kill you,” he says.\n\nTestifying in 2011 in connection with a lawsuit Overstock brought against Goldman and others in California, Cohodes said he and his partners speculated that Goldman shut the fund because it hadn’t borrowed shares for Copper River’s short sales and was covering its tracks after the SEC clamped down on naked shorting. He also said he didn’t know for sure. Goldman was removed from the case, which contended that prime brokerages intentionally drove down the price of Overstock’s shares through naked short selling, on the grounds that none of the alleged conduct had taken place in that state. Overstock later said that Goldman had settled a New Jersey action for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) and securities fraud claims following the California rulings. Goldman also agreed to pay fines to the SEC last year and in 2010 for violations of securities lending rules, not related to Copper River, without admitting or denying the allegations either time. “Mr. Cohodes is wrong,” Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said in a statement. “We met our obligations under applicable law,” he said. “Copper River’s problems were the result of the extreme stress in the financial markets at the time.”\nFor his part, Cohodes says Copper River didn’t sue Goldman because nobody had the appetite for a drawn-out legal battle. “I’m a really, really, really good investor, but obviously I was s----y at the investment business, because my fund closed due to what I would call factors beyond my control,” Cohodes says. Even so, he accepts responsibility. “I’m the captain of the ship,” he says. “The ship sank.”\n\n\nPhotographer: Brian Frank\nAlder Lane Farm, which Cohodes kept in a settlement when he got divorced in May 2011, is sprinkled with physical reminders of battles past. They include the pinball machines (thank you, Bally), a Porsche 911 with customized plates that say “Gowex” (a Spanish telecommunications company he bet against), and a 6-year-old Holsteiner horse named Concordia after the drugmaker whose former CEO is suing him. “It showed up the day I got sued—so it just had to be,” he says. He even names some of his roughly 300 chickens after friends and foes. Anyone who doesn’t take the investing game personally is wrong, Cohodes says.\n\nWhich could help explain his time off from investing. “I don’t want to say I took a break from investing, but I sort of took a break from it and just sort of decompressed,” he says of the period following Copper River’s closure. After a couple of years, he began to miss it and started to spend more and more time on short investments. He became a lively presence on Twitter, where he has more than 8,000 followers. He says it’s easier for him to be forthright on social media than it would be if he were still working for a hedge fund, where lawsuits are bad for business.\n\nHe can be forthright elsewhere, too. At a Grant’s Interest Rate Observer investing conference in New York in October, Cohodes shared the stage with some of the biggest names in the industry, including Julian Robertson of Tiger Management fame and bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach. Some people in the audience were taken aback by Cohodes’s “rhetorical style,” as Jim Grant, who organizes the event, puts it. “Marc comes across as kind of an angry and certainly intentionally profane growling bear,” he says. “Beneath that exterior beats the heart of an idealist.”\n\nCohodes himself says his energy for short selling also comes from having a competitive nature that makes him relish the fight—all the more so if he thinks he’s being disrespected, especially by what the straight-talking self-described “scrapper” sees as ­buttoned-up Harvard types. Making money from short selling, he says, isn’t that important to him, although the two Porsches on his farm suggest he’s far from short himself.\n\n\nThis story appears in the February / March 2017 issue of Bloomberg Markets.\nCover artwork: Oriol Angrill Jordà\nWhatever the motivation, most roads for Cohodes these days lead over the U.S. border into the Great White North. When many other short sellers were descending on Valeant, whose stock fell 86 percent last year, he also became interested in the smaller Concordia, which he says is bedecked in red flags. The company’s founder, Mark Thompson, and other executives previously worked for Biovail, which the SEC charged with fraudulent accounting, Cohodes says, recalling his jockey theory. (Biovail agreed to pay $10 million to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations. Thompson, who stepped down as Concordia chairman and CEO in November, wasn’t accused of wrongdoing at Biovail.) Concordia went public through a reverse merger, a process that the SEC says can sometimes lead to fraud and other abuses. It expanded through acquisitions, which short sellers such as Cohodes often see as grounds for suspicion, because they can open the door to accounting tricks. And its business model of buying drugs and jacking up their prices (similar to the strategy that was used by Valeant) is coming under increasing scrutiny. (“Valeant’s new management team is working diligently to earn the confidence of the investment community and deliver on our commitments,” including repaying debt, says company spokesman Scott Hirsch.)\n\nCohodes became convinced Concordia would buckle under the large debts it assumed to fund its acquisitions. Dissecting the company’s accounts, Cohodes noticed that it was recognizing revenue on shipment rather than when products are sold to the consumer and that it had opaque reserves. Those practices are not illegal but have been used by companies in the past to inflate sales in what’s known as channel stuffing.\n\nBefore long, Concordia’s earnings started to miss estimates. Last September, the U.K. government introduced a bill proposing controls on overcharging in the pharmaceutical industry. Debating the bill, members of Parliament said it would close a loophole that allowed companies including Amdipharm Mercury, as Concordia’s biggest purchase was named before Concordia bought it, to acquire off-patent generic drugs with dominant market positions and push up their prices. “When price gouging ends, the channel gets drained and the results just completely suck,” Cohodes says. (Concordia didn’t respond to requests for comment but said in a statement in December that it believes it can service its debt while focusing on developing a new long-term plan.)\n\nConcordia shares plunged 95 percent in 2016, handing Cohodes a huge profit. He also got slapped with a libel and defamation lawsuit from then-CEO Thompson for comments he made on Canadian TV about the executive’s work history. Cohodes traveled to Toronto in January and filed a 494-page motion to contest the suit, which he sees as a standard tactic to silence short sellers. (Peter Downard, Thompson’s lawyer, disagrees: “Don’t be diverted by the suggestion that Mr. Cohodes is being sued for criticizing Concordia. Mr. Cohodes went on television and alleged that Mark engaged in misconduct early in his career, long before he was involved with Concordia.”) Cohodes continues to berate Thompson on Twitter. He says he spent about 2,000 hours researching the company and considers it his best-ever short investment.\n\nSince the fall of 2014, Cohodes has also been shorting another Canadian business, mortgage lender Home Capital Group in Toronto. The company said in 2015 that it suspended 45 brokers for alleged mortgage fraud, and its stock fell by almost half from November 2014 through the end of January. (Home Capital declined to comment for this story, but it said last year that “there have been no unusual credit issues on these mortgages.”)\n\nFor all the good bets, Cohodes says, there have been plenty of bad ones, too. Take Ebix, a U.S. supplier of software to the insurance industry, and Keurig Green Mountain, a specialty coffee maker. Ebix surged more than sixfold from June 2013, and Keurig Green Mountain was taken private at a large premium. Still, Cohodes says his return to short selling has “been blessed” and he’s “had two really good years,” but he declines to give details.\n\nAs well as betting against many companies in Canada, which he sees as a prime hunting ground, Cohodes has appeared frequently in Canadian media since 2015 to expose what he sees as the reason for the bubble in Vancouver real estate. He says the provincial government has ignored or even encouraged illegal money entering the country from China. Cohodes says he’s campaigning on this issue without a profit motive: His Canadian real estate shorts have no exposure to Vancouver, where the price of a typical single-family home surged to C$1.5 million ($1.1 million), about 20 times what the median household earns in a year. In August, British Columbia’s government imposed a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers to address the situation that Cohodes helped highlight. Vancouver home sales plunged 40 percent in January over a year earlier.\n\n\nIn addition to looking after his son and communicating to regulators, investors, and journalists about his short bets, Cohodes makes time to mentor people who share the fraud-sniffing gene and whom he’s identified as bright prospects in the short-­selling business. He speaks with them regularly about their ideas—something he says also benefits him, especially because he no longer has the research and analytical resources of his own fund.\n\nIt’s something he’s always done. Jerome Souza was a batboy for the Oakland A’s before Cohodes took him under his wing, gave him a job at Copper River, and taught him how to be a short seller. After the fund closed, Cohodes was supportive when Souza decided to use the detective skills he learned there to go to work for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Souza says Cohodes is like a dad to him. The Sunday after Thanksgiving, Souza, 32, and his family drove 13 hours from Tucson to have dinner with Cohodes, his second wife, Aurora, 51, and Max.\n\nThen there’s Fahmi Quadir. “I don’t know whether to call him my ideal father or ideal lover,” says Quadir, 26, who started short selling in 2015 at Krensavage Asset Management in New York. Cohodes calls her “the assassin,” because she operates in the shadows and her short research can be devastating. “He’s so passionate about what he does,” she says of Cohodes. “Meeting Marc changed my life and made me realize what it means to be a short seller.”\n\nCohodes says he’ll never go back to managing other people’s money, because his new setup gives him the joys of being a short seller without hassles like meeting investors. “Marc has figured out a way to be in the game without being in the game,” Pacific Square’s Greenberg says.\n\nAt Concordia’s shareholder meeting in April 2016, according to local media reports, then-CEO Thompson said, “If you are a chicken farmer, your chickens will come home to roost.” Cohodes interpreted this as a threat: that he’d get what’s coming to him. Being threatened, Cohodes says, isn’t something he takes kindly to, and when he is he becomes even more determined.\n\nAs for those chickens, sure, Cohodes’s eggs may sell for $13 a dozen at Bi-Rite Market in San Francisco, but he warns Thompson and other targets, present and future, not to under­estimate him. “Yeah, I have chickens, and yeah, I sell eggs in the city, but I spend about 1/32nd of my day doing chicken work,” he says. “I’m happy that he thinks I’m a chicken farmer. But I’m still intensely focused on some stuff. I will knock their heads off.” \n\n—Redmond is Japan markets editor for Bloomberg News in Tokyo.

And he’s passing along his “dying art” to a new generation of troublemakers.\n\nAUTHOR: Tom Redmond\nDATE: February 9, 2017, 2:00 AM PST\n\nThe roosters start crowing at 4 a.m. on Alder Lane Farm, about an hour north of San Francisco on the edge of Sonoma wine country. While horses stir in their stables and chickens begin to roam the 20-acre property, one of the world’s most fearsome short sellers puts on his usual attire—shorts and flip-flops—and makes his way in the dark to the room behind his garage. Six pinball machines, a gigantic flatscreen, and a pingpong table compete for attention. If not for the Bloomberg terminal in the corner, you might assume this was your typical man cave.\n\nBut let’s not dwell on Marc Cohodes’s pastured chickens, or his show-jumping horses, or even his homemade apricot jam that, on special occasions, San Francisco’s Una Pizza Napoletana puts on its pies in lieu of tomato sauce. Some of the most respected people in the investing industry say that, dating back to the 1980s, nobody has had a better nose for sniffing out fraud than the 56-year-old Cohodes. He’s exposed suspect accounting at a number of high-profile companies, including the Belgian speech-­recognition software developer Lernout & Hauspie, which went bankrupt in 2001 after being valued at about $10 billion, and mortgage lender NovaStar Financial, where his efforts earned him a Harvard Business School case study published in 2013.\n\n\nPhotographer: Brian Frank\n“I would not want to be his adversary if I was still a criminal today,” says Sam Antar, who was sentenced to six months of house arrest and 1,200 hours of community service for cooking the books at New York consumer-electronics chain Crazy Eddie in one of the largest securities frauds unearthed in the 1980s. “A character like Marc”—the two crossed paths later in his life when both were focused on detecting fraud—“you stay away from.”\n\nAnd that’s been relatively easy for at least part of the past eight years. In 2008 the hedge fund Cohodes worked at for more than two decades went out of business under controversial circumstances. He maintains that Goldman Sachs, its prime broker, closed it too hastily by making needless margin calls, a claim Goldman disputes. The fallout spurred a bout of what Cohodes likens to post-traumatic stress disorder. “What happened to me would put the average person under,” he says. He retreated to his farm, where he recuperated by spending his days delivering eggs to San Francisco, cheering on the Oakland Raiders, and traveling to see a friend’s rock band, Collective Soul. Besides, the vast majority of stocks were rising because of central bank stimulus, depriving him of ideal opportunities as a short seller.\n\n“Legitimate companies don’t know who the f--- I am. And they don’t care. The bad guys? They know. And they do care”\n\nNow Cohodes is back. His time among the horses and chickens—outside the money management industry—may even have helped him return to the top of his game. Slimmed down and fighting fit, he’s been winning big on a series of short bets against Canadian companies since he made his comeback. Cohodes says he’s been betting against embattled Valeant Pharmaceuticals International since the summer of 2015. Around the same time, he began shorting another debt-laden Canadian drugmaker, Concordia International, which he calls “the poor man’s Valeant.” Both stocks lost most of their value last year.\n\nCohodes says he’s committed to exposing companies that he believes may be ripping off ordinary, unwary investors—“Joe Six-pack,” as he puts it. “Legitimate companies don’t know who the f--- I am. And they don’t care,” Cohodes says. “The bad guys? They know. And they do care.” And he’ll go to great lengths to chase them down: dumpster-diving to find clues of wrongdoing, lambasting enemies on Twitter (where his rambunctious character is on full display), and hotfooting it across Las Vegas to check whether new business offices reported by NovaStar were real. (They weren’t, according to Cohodes; one was a private home, another a massage parlor.) “I’m a pretty driven guy,” he says.\n\nIndeed, press him on his return to the markets, and Cohodes will reveal another reason that brought him back from the wilderness. Short selling—borrowing stock and selling it, hoping to profit by buying it back later at a lower price—is a “dying art,” he fears. Short-biased funds managed only $5.5 billion in assets as of the end of September, a tiny fraction of the roughly $3 trillion the hedge fund industry oversees, according to Hedge Fund Research. The number of short-biased funds had fallen to 18 at that time, from 50 in 2009. Cohodes wants to make sure the “old-school” craft gets passed along to a new generation of people with—he jokes—that “genetic defect” that makes them want to take on all of Wall Street.\n\n\nAs the bounty hunters of the stock market, short sellers have uncovered some major failings over the years. Think Jim Chanos’s role in highlighting the fraud at Enron, or David Einhorn’s call on Lehman Brothers. But the long list of allegations against short sellers is as old as the markets themselves. They spread false rumors to profit when stocks fall, a practice dubbed “short and distort” that has sometimes gotten them into trouble with regulators. They conspire to torpedo share prices in “bear raids.” They destroy good companies and cause people to lose their jobs. They have many natural enemies, including investors betting shares will rise, analysts issuing buy recommendations, and executives whose whole careers are suddenly called into question when short sellers level charges against them. And they’re not regulated the way Wall Street analysts are, so they aren’t as accountable.\n\nTo short a stock and then publicly recommend selling it “absolutely should be illegal,” says Amir Anvarzadeh, head of Japanese equity sales at brokerage BGC Partners in Singapore, stressing he doesn’t know Cohodes and is talking about short selling in general. “It’s morally wrong. It’s called front-running, and it’s wrong.”\n\nAt the same time, the risks short sellers take can be huge. Stocks tend to edge higher naturally, doubling or tripling even when the case against them is justified. That can mean losses for the short seller, not to mention psychological despair. Then there’s the vilification—and the lawsuits, four of which Cohodes has experienced. It’s “just a nasty, difficult, ruthless, bare-knuckled, tough business,” he says. “And no one cuts you any breaks.”\n\nYet there are people who wouldn’t do anything else.\n\nCohodes’s journey to the top ranks of short selling began in Chicago, where he didn’t do well at school—he recalls his ­second-grade teacher worrying he’d end up in jail. He managed to avoid that fate, graduating from Babson College in Massachusetts, where he studied finance. In 1982 he landed a position back in his hometown with Northern Trust, where he met an analyst named Paul Landini who taught him about short selling. The two began visiting a local gaming arcade after work. There, one of Landini’s hunches grew into a conviction as they watched people spend their quarters: Video games would soon usurp pinball machines. They shorted a major pinball company, Bally Manufacturing, and watched with euphoria as the shares lost half their value from the start of 1983 to the end of 1984. Cohodes was hooked.\n\nIn 1985, Cohodes took a job in New York with David Rocker, who’d just started a hedge fund that would come to specialize in short selling. “They were very thorough, swung big, and put together a really nice track record in short selling, which is really hard to do,” says Jeff Ubben, who runs ValueAct Capital Management, an activist fund in San Francisco.

When he gets his jaws on the leg of whatever he’s going after, he can’t let go”\n\nOne of Cohodes’s most famous shorts at Rocker Partners came from a desire to help his son Max, now 30, who was born with cerebral palsy and lives in his own house on the farm. Cohodes thought Lernout & Hauspie’s speech-recognition software might help Max communicate, but he soon found it recognized little of what people said. In the summer of 1998, Rocker Partners started shorting the company, which counted Microsoft as a large shareholder. So began a long campaign of tipping off the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to irregularities in L&H’s books and briefing financial journalists.\n\nThe stock almost tripled in the first three months of 2000, causing several investors to withdraw money from Rocker Partners.

At the end of the day we sort of put it behind us”\n\nByrne says he was “completely vindicated,” because defendants in lawsuits Overstock brought, including Goldman and Cohodes’s firm, eventually settled. There’s a difference between betting against a horse and “trying to poison” it, he says. Still, “I have a strange affection for Marc as one sometimes develops for an opponent,” Byrne says of Cohodes now. “At the end of the day we sort of put it behind us.”\n\nThe 2005 lawsuit hastened Rocker’s retirement the following year—at least according to Cohodes—and indirectly had a hand in the fund’s demise. As for Rocker and Cohodes, they don’t speak. Cohodes blamed Rocker for unnecessarily riling Byrne, while the argument can be made that the tactics Rocker Partners used against Overstock were no different from those it employed for any other short investment. (Rocker declined to comment for this story.)\n\nWhatever the case, Cohodes was left in control of the company, whose name he changed to Copper River Partners. Then came the financial crisis, which should have been a godsend for a short-­biased fund. “We were having an outstanding year. Outstanding,” Cohodes says. “We were knocking the ball out of the f---ing park.”\n\n\nUntil things started to go wrong.\n\nOn Sept. 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Lehman Brothers International in London, which Copper River used as a prime broker, owed the hedge fund about $100 million at the time, says Phil Renna, who was Copper River’s chief financial officer. Copper River lost access to that money. Days later, in an echo of Byrne’s campaign, the SEC took action against naked short selling. That spurred buying of heavily shorted stocks including Jos. A. Bank Clothiers and Overstock, creating what Cohodes calls “horrific” losses for Copper River. Then the SEC banned short selling of financial companies, which again sent shares the fund was short surging.\n\nAt that point, Goldman stepped in. As Copper River’s main prime broker, it instituted house margin calls, which unlike regulatory margin calls are made at its discretion. Before long, Goldman was liquidating Copper River’s short positions. Goldman blocked Cohodes’s attempt to sell them to another hedge fund, he says. By October the company’s funds were down more than 50 percent. Copper River was unsalvageable. “It’s almost like a bomb blows up near you or near your brain, and it sort of blows your eardrums out, but it doesn’t kill you,” he says.\n\nTestifying in 2011 in connection with a lawsuit Overstock brought against Goldman and others in California, Cohodes said he and his partners speculated that Goldman shut the fund because it hadn’t borrowed shares for Copper River’s short sales and was covering its tracks after the SEC clamped down on naked shorting. He also said he didn’t know for sure. Goldman was removed from the case, which contended that prime brokerages intentionally drove down the price of Overstock’s shares through naked short selling, on the grounds that none of the alleged conduct had taken place in that state. Overstock later said that Goldman had settled a New Jersey action for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) and securities fraud claims following the California rulings. Goldman also agreed to pay fines to the SEC last year and in 2010 for violations of securities lending rules, not related to Copper River, without admitting or denying the allegations either time. “Mr. Cohodes is wrong,” Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said in a statement. “We met our obligations under applicable law,” he said. “Copper River’s problems were the result of the extreme stress in the financial markets at the time.”\nFor his part, Cohodes says Copper River didn’t sue Goldman because nobody had the appetite for a drawn-out legal battle. “I’m a really, really, really good investor, but obviously I was s----y at the investment business, because my fund closed due to what I would call factors beyond my control,” Cohodes says. Even so, he accepts responsibility. “I’m the captain of the ship,” he says. “The ship sank.”\n\n\nPhotographer: Brian Frank\nAlder Lane Farm, which Cohodes kept in a settlement when he got divorced in May 2011, is sprinkled with physical reminders of battles past. They include the pinball machines (thank you, Bally), a Porsche 911 with customized plates that say “Gowex” (a Spanish telecommunications company he bet against), and a 6-year-old Holsteiner horse named Concordia after the drugmaker whose former CEO is suing him. “It showed up the day I got sued—so it just had to be,” he says. He even names some of his roughly 300 chickens after friends and foes. Anyone who doesn’t take the investing game personally is wrong, Cohodes says.\n\nWhich could help explain his time off from investing. “I don’t want to say I took a break from investing, but I sort of took a break from it and just sort of decompressed,” he says of the period following Copper River’s closure. After a couple of years, he began to miss it and started to spend more and more time on short investments. He became a lively presence on Twitter, where he has more than 8,000 followers. He says it’s easier for him to be forthright on social media than it would be if he were still working for a hedge fund, where lawsuits are bad for business.\n\nHe can be forthright elsewhere, too. At a Grant’s Interest Rate Observer investing conference in New York in October, Cohodes shared the stage with some of the biggest names in the industry, including Julian Robertson of Tiger Management fame and bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach. Some people in the audience were taken aback by Cohodes’s “rhetorical style,” as Jim Grant, who organizes the event, puts it. “Marc comes across as kind of an angry and certainly intentionally profane growling bear,” he says. “Beneath that exterior beats the heart of an idealist.”\n\nCohodes himself says his energy for short selling also comes from having a competitive nature that makes him relish the fight—all the more so if he thinks he’s being disrespected, especially by what the straight-talking self-described “scrapper” sees as ­buttoned-up Harvard types. Making money from short selling, he says, isn’t that important to him, although the two Porsches on his farm suggest he’s far from short himself.\n\n\nThis story appears in the February / March 2017 issue of Bloomberg Markets.\nCover artwork: Oriol Angrill Jordà\nWhatever the motivation, most roads for Cohodes these days lead over the U.S. border into the Great White North. When many other short sellers were descending on Valeant, whose stock fell 86 percent last year, he also became interested in the smaller Concordia, which he says is bedecked in red flags. The company’s founder, Mark Thompson, and other executives previously worked for Biovail, which the SEC charged with fraudulent accounting, Cohodes says, recalling his jockey theory. (Biovail agreed to pay $10 million to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations. Thompson, who stepped down as Concordia chairman and CEO in November, wasn’t accused of wrongdoing at Biovail.) Concordia went public through a reverse merger, a process that the SEC says can sometimes lead to fraud and other abuses. It expanded through acquisitions, which short sellers such as Cohodes often see as grounds for suspicion, because they can open the door to accounting tricks. And its business model of buying drugs and jacking up their prices (similar to the strategy that was used by Valeant) is coming under increasing scrutiny. (“Valeant’s new management team is working diligently to earn the confidence of the investment community and deliver on our commitments,” including repaying debt, says company spokesman Scott Hirsch.)\n\nCohodes became convinced Concordia would buckle under the large debts it assumed to fund its acquisitions. Dissecting the company’s accounts, Cohodes noticed that it was recognizing revenue on shipment rather than when products are sold to the consumer and that it had opaque reserves. Those practices are not illegal but have been used by companies in the past to inflate sales in what’s known as channel stuffing.\n\nBefore long, Concordia’s earnings started to miss estimates. Last September, the U.K. government introduced a bill proposing controls on overcharging in the pharmaceutical industry. Debating the bill, members of Parliament said it would close a loophole that allowed companies including Amdipharm Mercury, as Concordia’s biggest purchase was named before Concordia bought it, to acquire off-patent generic drugs with dominant market positions and push up their prices. “When price gouging ends, the channel gets drained and the results just completely suck,” Cohodes says. (Concordia didn’t respond to requests for comment but said in a statement in December that it believes it can service its debt while focusing on developing a new long-term plan.)\n\nConcordia shares plunged 95 percent in 2016, handing Cohodes a huge profit. He also got slapped with a libel and defamation lawsuit from then-CEO Thompson for comments he made on Canadian TV about the executive’s work history. Cohodes traveled to Toronto in January and filed a 494-page motion to contest the suit, which he sees as a standard tactic to silence short sellers. (Peter Downard, Thompson’s lawyer, disagrees: “Don’t be diverted by the suggestion that Mr. Cohodes is being sued for criticizing Concordia. Mr. Cohodes went on television and alleged that Mark engaged in misconduct early in his career, long before he was involved with Concordia.”) Cohodes continues to berate Thompson on Twitter. He says he spent about 2,000 hours researching the company and considers it his best-ever short investment.\n\nSince the fall of 2014, Cohodes has also been shorting another Canadian business, mortgage lender Home Capital Group in Toronto. The company said in 2015 that it suspended 45 brokers for alleged mortgage fraud, and its stock fell by almost half from November 2014 through the end of January. (Home Capital declined to comment for this story, but it said last year that “there have been no unusual credit issues on these mortgages.”)\n\nFor all the good bets, Cohodes says, there have been plenty of bad ones, too. Take Ebix, a U.S. supplier of software to the insurance industry, and Keurig Green Mountain, a specialty coffee maker. Ebix surged more than sixfold from June 2013, and Keurig Green Mountain was taken private at a large premium. Still, Cohodes says his return to short selling has “been blessed” and he’s “had two really good years,” but he declines to give details.\n\nAs well as betting against many companies in Canada, which he sees as a prime hunting ground, Cohodes has appeared frequently in Canadian media since 2015 to expose what he sees as the reason for the bubble in Vancouver real estate. He says the provincial government has ignored or even encouraged illegal money entering the country from China. Cohodes says he’s campaigning on this issue without a profit motive: His Canadian real estate shorts have no exposure to Vancouver, where the price of a typical single-family home surged to C$1.5 million ($1.1 million), about 20 times what the median household earns in a year. In August, British Columbia’s government imposed a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers to address the situation that Cohodes helped highlight. Vancouver home sales plunged 40 percent in January over a year earlier.\n\n\nIn addition to looking after his son and communicating to regulators, investors, and journalists about his short bets, Cohodes makes time to mentor people who share the fraud-sniffing gene and whom he’s identified as bright prospects in the short-­selling business. He speaks with them regularly about their ideas—something he says also benefits him, especially because he no longer has the research and analytical resources of his own fund.\n\nIt’s something he’s always done. Jerome Souza was a batboy for the Oakland A’s before Cohodes took him under his wing, gave him a job at Copper River, and taught him how to be a short seller. After the fund closed, Cohodes was supportive when Souza decided to use the detective skills he learned there to go to work for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Souza says Cohodes is like a dad to him. The Sunday after Thanksgiving, Souza, 32, and his family drove 13 hours from Tucson to have dinner with Cohodes, his second wife, Aurora, 51, and Max.\n\nThen there’s Fahmi Quadir. “I don’t know whether to call him my ideal father or ideal lover,” says Quadir, 26, who started short selling in 2015 at Krensavage Asset Management in New York. Cohodes calls her “the assassin,” because she operates in the shadows and her short research can be devastating. “He’s so passionate about what he does,” she says of Cohodes. “Meeting Marc changed my life and made me realize what it means to be a short seller.”\n\nCohodes says he’ll never go back to managing other people’s money, because his new setup gives him the joys of being a short seller without hassles like meeting investors. “Marc has figured out a way to be in the game without being in the game,” Pacific Square’s Greenberg says.\n\nAt Concordia’s shareholder meeting in April 2016, according to local media reports, then-CEO Thompson said, “If you are a chicken farmer, your chickens will come home to roost.” Cohodes interpreted this as a threat: that he’d get what’s coming to him. Being threatened, Cohodes says, isn’t something he takes kindly to, and when he is he becomes even more determined.\n\nAs for those chickens, sure, Cohodes’s eggs may sell for $13 a dozen at Bi-Rite Market in San Francisco, but he warns Thompson and other targets, present and future, not to under­estimate him. “Yeah, I have chickens, and yeah, I sell eggs in the city, but I spend about 1/32nd of my day doing chicken work,” he says. “I’m happy that he thinks I’m a chicken farmer. But I’m still intensely focused on some stuff. I will knock their heads off.” \n\n—Redmond is Japan markets editor for Bloomberg News in Tokyo.

And he’s passing along his “dying art” to a new generation of troublemakers.\n\nAUTHOR: Tom Redmond\nDATE: February 9, 2017, 2:00 AM PST\n\nThe roosters start crowing at 4 a.m. on Alder Lane Farm, about an hour north of San Francisco on the edge of Sonoma wine country. While horses stir in their stables and chickens begin to roam the 20-acre property, one of the world’s most fearsome short sellers puts on his usual attire—shorts and flip-flops—and makes his way in the dark to the room behind his garage. Six pinball machines, a gigantic flatscreen, and a pingpong table compete for attention. If not for the Bloomberg terminal in the corner, you might assume this was your typical man cave.\n\nBut let’s not dwell on Marc Cohodes’s pastured chickens, or his show-jumping horses, or even his homemade apricot jam that, on special occasions, San Francisco’s Una Pizza Napoletana puts on its pies in lieu of tomato sauce. Some of the most respected people in the investing industry say that, dating back to the 1980s, nobody has had a better nose for sniffing out fraud than the 56-year-old Cohodes. He’s exposed suspect accounting at a number of high-profile companies, including the Belgian speech-­recognition software developer Lernout & Hauspie, which went bankrupt in 2001 after being valued at about $10 billion, and mortgage lender NovaStar Financial, where his efforts earned him a Harvard Business School case study published in 2013.\n\n\nPhotographer: Brian Frank\n“I would not want to be his adversary if I was still a criminal today,” says Sam Antar, who was sentenced to six months of house arrest and 1,200 hours of community service for cooking the books at New York consumer-electronics chain Crazy Eddie in one of the largest securities frauds unearthed in the 1980s. “A character like Marc”—the two crossed paths later in his life when both were focused on detecting fraud—“you stay away from.”\n\nAnd that’s been relatively easy for at least part of the past eight years. In 2008 the hedge fund Cohodes worked at for more than two decades went out of business under controversial circumstances. He maintains that Goldman Sachs, its prime broker, closed it too hastily by making needless margin calls, a claim Goldman disputes. The fallout spurred a bout of what Cohodes likens to post-traumatic stress disorder. “What happened to me would put the average person under,” he says. He retreated to his farm, where he recuperated by spending his days delivering eggs to San Francisco, cheering on the Oakland Raiders, and traveling to see a friend’s rock band, Collective Soul. Besides, the vast majority of stocks were rising because of central bank stimulus, depriving him of ideal opportunities as a short seller.\n\n“Legitimate companies don’t know who the f--- I am. And they don’t care. The bad guys? They know. And they do care”\n\nNow Cohodes is back. His time among the horses and chickens—outside the money management industry—may even have helped him return to the top of his game. Slimmed down and fighting fit, he’s been winning big on a series of short bets against Canadian companies since he made his comeback. Cohodes says he’s been betting against embattled Valeant Pharmaceuticals International since the summer of 2015. Around the same time, he began shorting another debt-laden Canadian drugmaker, Concordia International, which he calls “the poor man’s Valeant.” Both stocks lost most of their value last year.\n\nCohodes says he’s committed to exposing companies that he believes may be ripping off ordinary, unwary investors—“Joe Six-pack,” as he puts it. “Legitimate companies don’t know who the f--- I am. And they don’t care,” Cohodes says. “The bad guys? They know. And they do care.” And he’ll go to great lengths to chase them down: dumpster-diving to find clues of wrongdoing, lambasting enemies on Twitter (where his rambunctious character is on full display), and hotfooting it across Las Vegas to check whether new business offices reported by NovaStar were real. (They weren’t, according to Cohodes; one was a private home, another a massage parlor.) “I’m a pretty driven guy,” he says.\n\nIndeed, press him on his return to the markets, and Cohodes will reveal another reason that brought him back from the wilderness. Short selling—borrowing stock and selling it, hoping to profit by buying it back later at a lower price—is a “dying art,” he fears. Short-biased funds managed only $5.5 billion in assets as of the end of September, a tiny fraction of the roughly $3 trillion the hedge fund industry oversees, according to Hedge Fund Research. The number of short-biased funds had fallen to 18 at that time, from 50 in 2009. Cohodes wants to make sure the “old-school” craft gets passed along to a new generation of people with—he jokes—that “genetic defect” that makes them want to take on all of Wall Street.\n\n\nAs the bounty hunters of the stock market, short sellers have uncovered some major failings over the years. Think Jim Chanos’s role in highlighting the fraud at Enron, or David Einhorn’s call on Lehman Brothers. But the long list of allegations against short sellers is as old as the markets themselves. They spread false rumors to profit when stocks fall, a practice dubbed “short and distort” that has sometimes gotten them into trouble with regulators. They conspire to torpedo share prices in “bear raids.” They destroy good companies and cause people to lose their jobs. They have many natural enemies, including investors betting shares will rise, analysts issuing buy recommendations, and executives whose whole careers are suddenly called into question when short sellers level charges against them. And they’re not regulated the way Wall Street analysts are, so they aren’t as accountable.\n\nTo short a stock and then publicly recommend selling it “absolutely should be illegal,” says Amir Anvarzadeh, head of Japanese equity sales at brokerage BGC Partners in Singapore, stressing he doesn’t know Cohodes and is talking about short selling in general. “It’s morally wrong. It’s called front-running, and it’s wrong.”\n\nAt the same time, the risks short sellers take can be huge. Stocks tend to edge higher naturally, doubling or tripling even when the case against them is justified. That can mean losses for the short seller, not to mention psychological despair. Then there’s the vilification—and the lawsuits, four of which Cohodes has experienced. It’s “just a nasty, difficult, ruthless, bare-knuckled, tough business,” he says. “And no one cuts you any breaks.”\n\nYet there are people who wouldn’t do anything else.\n\nCohodes’s journey to the top ranks of short selling began in Chicago, where he didn’t do well at school—he recalls his ­second-grade teacher worrying he’d end up in jail. He managed to avoid that fate, graduating from Babson College in Massachusetts, where he studied finance. In 1982 he landed a position back in his hometown with Northern Trust, where he met an analyst named Paul Landini who taught him about short selling. The two began visiting a local gaming arcade after work. There, one of Landini’s hunches grew into a conviction as they watched people spend their quarters: Video games would soon usurp pinball machines. They shorted a major pinball company, Bally Manufacturing, and watched with euphoria as the shares lost half their value from the start of 1983 to the end of 1984. Cohodes was hooked.\n\nIn 1985, Cohodes took a job in New York with David Rocker, who’d just started a hedge fund that would come to specialize in short selling. “They were very thorough, swung big, and put together a really nice track record in short selling, which is really hard to do,” says Jeff Ubben, who runs ValueAct Capital Management, an activist fund in San Francisco. Rocker Partners posted a gross annual return of 12 percent from April 1985 to the end of 2007, when shorting the S&P 500 would have produced an 11 percent yearly loss.\n\n“He’s like a terrier. When he gets his jaws on the leg of whatever he’s going after, he can’t let go”\n\nOne of Cohodes’s most famous shorts at Rocker Partners came from a desire to help his son Max, now 30, who was born with cerebral palsy and lives in his own house on the farm. Cohodes thought Lernout & Hauspie’s speech-recognition software might help Max communicate, but he soon found it recognized little of what people said. In the summer of 1998, Rocker Partners started shorting the company, which counted Microsoft as a large shareholder. So began a long campaign of tipping off the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to irregularities in L&H’s books and briefing financial journalists.\n\nThe stock almost tripled in the first three months of 2000, causing several investors to withdraw money from Rocker Partners. Only afterward did the hedge fund get its big break. When L&H started filing detailed quarterly U.S. disclosures following the acquisition of two American companies, Cohodes and others noticed unusually large sales to South Korea, which were largely exposed as fake. In 2001 the company filed for bankruptcy. In 2010 a Belgian court sentenced founders Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie to five-year prison terms, two years of which were suspended. The doggedness with which Cohodes pursued L&H was typical of him, says Jeff Matthews, who worked at Rocker Partners from 1989 to 1993: “He has the biggest balls of anyone I’ve ever known.”\n\n\nBet the jockey, not the horse, Cohodes says. Find executives who once ran companies that performed poorly or were accused of wrongdoing. Look for red flags—serial acquisitions of companies, opaque accounting, overstated numbers. If things don’t add up, don’t stop until you find out why. “He’s like a terrier,” says Herb Greenberg, who co-manages investment analysis company Pacific Square Research. “When he gets his jaws on the leg of whatever he’s going after, he can’t let go.”\n\nCohodes and Rocker Partners’ successes include NovaStar, the subprime lender he sparred with before the financial crisis; it was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2008. Another was AremisSoft, a business-management software provider that artificially inflated revenue. It filed for bankruptcy in 2002, but not before it sued Rocker Partners and others for stock manipulation, a suit it quickly dropped. In 2010, Roys Poyiadjis, the former chief executive officer, was sentenced to probation for a stock fraud that a judge said was “of almost unthinkable magnitude.”\n\nIn the case of AaiPharma—a drugmaker in North Carolina that was delisted, and whose former chief operating officer pleaded guilty in 2005 to fraud conspiracy charges—victory was particularly sweet for Cohodes. He recalls when the company announced in April 2004 that it had received subpoenas from a grand jury seeking testimony and documents concerning its financial reporting. “I just, like, opened the window, and I yelled out at the top of my lungs,” Cohodes says. “This piece of s--- stock was kicking our ass for so long.”\n\nIt was the knock-down, drag-out fight with Utah-based Overstock.com that may have helped sink Rocker Partners. Patrick Byrne, the founder and CEO of the discount retailer, sued the hedge fund in August 2005, claiming it worked with a research firm to manipulate the company’s shares. Byrne suggested that “miscreant hedge funds,” journalists, foreign stock exchanges, and a clearinghouse were among those conspiring to drive down his stock using naked shorting—that is, selling short shares that ­haven’t been borrowed.\n\n“I have a strange affection for Marc as one sometimes develops for an opponent. At the end of the day we sort of put it behind us”\n\nByrne says he was “completely vindicated,” because defendants in lawsuits Overstock brought, including Goldman and Cohodes’s firm, eventually settled. There’s a difference between betting against a horse and “trying to poison” it, he says. Still, “I have a strange affection for Marc as one sometimes develops for an opponent,” Byrne says of Cohodes now. “At the end of the day we sort of put it behind us.”\n\nThe 2005 lawsuit hastened Rocker’s retirement the following year—at least according to Cohodes—and indirectly had a hand in the fund’s demise. As for Rocker and Cohodes, they don’t speak. Cohodes blamed Rocker for unnecessarily riling Byrne, while the argument can be made that the tactics Rocker Partners used against Overstock were no different from those it employed for any other short investment. (Rocker declined to comment for this story.)\n\nWhatever the case, Cohodes was left in control of the company, whose name he changed to Copper River Partners. Then came the financial crisis, which should have been a godsend for a short-­biased fund. “We were having an outstanding year. Outstanding,” Cohodes says. “We were knocking the ball out of the f---ing park.”\n\n\nUntil things started to go wrong.\n\nOn Sept. 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Lehman Brothers International in London, which Copper River used as a prime broker, owed the hedge fund about $100 million at the time, says Phil Renna, who was Copper River’s chief financial officer. Copper River lost access to that money. Days later, in an echo of Byrne’s campaign, the SEC took action against naked short selling. That spurred buying of heavily shorted stocks including Jos. A. Bank Clothiers and Overstock, creating what Cohodes calls “horrific” losses for Copper River. Then the SEC banned short selling of financial companies, which again sent shares the fund was short surging.\n\nAt that point, Goldman stepped in. As Copper River’s main prime broker, it instituted house margin calls, which unlike regulatory margin calls are made at its discretion. Before long, Goldman was liquidating Copper River’s short positions. Goldman blocked Cohodes’s attempt to sell them to another hedge fund, he says. By October the company’s funds were down more than 50 percent. Copper River was unsalvageable. “It’s almost like a bomb blows up near you or near your brain, and it sort of blows your eardrums out, but it doesn’t kill you,” he says.\n\nTestifying in 2011 in connection with a lawsuit Overstock brought against Goldman and others in California, Cohodes said he and his partners speculated that Goldman shut the fund because it hadn’t borrowed shares for Copper River’s short sales and was covering its tracks after the SEC clamped down on naked shorting.

The company’s founder, Mark Thompson, and other executives previously worked for Biovail, which the SEC charged with fraudulent accounting, Cohodes says, recalling his jockey theory. (Biovail agreed to pay $10 million to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations. Thompson, who stepped down as Concordia chairman and CEO in November, wasn’t accused of wrongdoing at Biovail.) Concordia went public through a reverse merger, a process that the SEC says can sometimes lead to fraud and other abuses. It expanded through acquisitions, which short sellers such as Cohodes often see as grounds for suspicion, because they can open the door to accounting tricks. And its business model of buying drugs and jacking up their prices (similar to the strategy that was used by Valeant) is coming under increasing scrutiny. (“Valeant’s new management team is working diligently to earn the confidence of the investment community and deliver on our commitments,” including repaying debt, says company spokesman Scott Hirsch.)\n\nCohodes became convinced Concordia would buckle under the large debts it assumed to fund its acquisitions. Dissecting the company’s accounts, Cohodes noticed that it was recognizing revenue on shipment rather than when products are sold to the consumer and that it had opaque reserves. Those practices are not illegal but have been used by companies in the past to inflate sales in what’s known as channel stuffing.\n\nBefore long, Concordia’s earnings started to miss estimates. Last September, the U.K. government introduced a bill proposing controls on overcharging in the pharmaceutical industry. Debating the bill, members of Parliament said it would close a loophole that allowed companies including Amdipharm Mercury, as Concordia’s biggest purchase was named before Concordia bought it, to acquire off-patent generic drugs with dominant market positions and push up their prices. “When price gouging ends, the channel gets drained and the results just completely suck,” Cohodes says. (Concordia didn’t respond to requests for comment but said in a statement in December that it believes it can service its debt while focusing on developing a new long-term plan.)\n\nConcordia shares plunged 95 percent in 2016, handing Cohodes a huge profit. He also got slapped with a libel and defamation lawsuit from then-CEO Thompson for comments he made on Canadian TV about the executive’s work history. Cohodes traveled to Toronto in January and filed a 494-page motion to contest the suit, which he sees as a standard tactic to silence short sellers. (Peter Downard, Thompson’s lawyer, disagrees: “Don’t be diverted by the suggestion that Mr. Cohodes is being sued for criticizing Concordia. Mr. Cohodes went on television and alleged that Mark engaged in misconduct early in his career, long before he was involved with Concordia.”) Cohodes continues to berate Thompson on Twitter. He says he spent about 2,000 hours researching the company and considers it his best-ever short investment.\n\nSince the fall of 2014, Cohodes has also been shorting another Canadian business, mortgage lender Home Capital Group in Toronto. The company said in 2015 that it suspended 45 brokers for alleged mortgage fraud, and its stock fell by almost half from November 2014 through the end of January. (Home Capital declined to comment for this story, but it said last year that “there have been no unusual credit issues on these mortgages.”)\n\nFor all the good bets, Cohodes says, there have been plenty of bad ones, too. Take Ebix, a U.S. supplier of software to the insurance industry, and Keurig Green Mountain, a specialty coffee maker. Ebix surged more than sixfold from June 2013, and Keurig Green Mountain was taken private at a large premium. Still, Cohodes says his return to short selling has “been blessed” and he’s “had two really good years,” but he declines to give details.\n\nAs well as betting against many companies in Canada, which he sees as a prime hunting ground, Cohodes has appeared frequently in Canadian media since 2015 to expose what he sees as the reason for the bubble in Vancouver real estate. He says the provincial government has ignored or even encouraged illegal money entering the country from China. Cohodes says he’s campaigning on this issue without a profit motive: His Canadian real estate shorts have no exposure to Vancouver, where the price of a typical single-family home surged to C$1.5 million ($1.1 million), about 20 times what the median household earns in a year. In August, British Columbia’s government imposed a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers to address the situation that Cohodes helped highlight. Vancouver home sales plunged 40 percent in January over a year earlier.\n\n\nIn addition to looking after his son and communicating to regulators, investors, and journalists about his short bets, Cohodes makes time to mentor people who share the fraud-sniffing gene and whom he’s identified as bright prospects in the short-­selling business. He speaks with them regularly about their ideas—something he says also benefits him, especially because he no longer has the research and analytical resources of his own fund.\n\nIt’s something he’s always done. Jerome Souza was a batboy for the Oakland A’s before Cohodes took him under his wing, gave him a job at Copper River, and taught him how to be a short seller. After the fund closed, Cohodes was supportive when Souza decided to use the detective skills he learned there to go to work for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Souza says Cohodes is like a dad to him. The Sunday after Thanksgiving, Souza, 32, and his family drove 13 hours from Tucson to have dinner with Cohodes, his second wife, Aurora, 51, and Max.\n\nThen there’s Fahmi Quadir. “I don’t know whether to call him my ideal father or ideal lover,” says Quadir, 26, who started short selling in 2015 at Krensavage Asset Management in New York. Cohodes calls her “the assassin,” because she operates in the shadows and her short research can be devastating. “He’s so passionate about what he does,” she says of Cohodes. “Meeting Marc changed my life and made me realize what it means to be a short seller.”\n\nCohodes says he’ll never go back to managing other people’s money, because his new setup gives him the joys of being a short seller without hassles like meeting investors. “Marc has figured out a way to be in the game without being in the game,” Pacific Square’s Greenberg says.\n\nAt Concordia’s shareholder meeting in April 2016, according to local media reports, then-CEO Thompson said, “If you are a chicken farmer, your chickens will come home to roost.” Cohodes interpreted this as a threat: that he’d get what’s coming to him. Being threatened, Cohodes says, isn’t something he takes kindly to, and when he is he becomes even more determined.\n\nAs for those chickens, sure, Cohodes’s eggs may sell for $13 a dozen at Bi-Rite Market in San Francisco, but he warns Thompson and other targets, present and future, not to under­estimate him. “Yeah, I have chickens, and yeah, I sell eggs in the city, but I spend about 1/32nd of my day doing chicken work,” he says. “I’m happy that he thinks I’m a chicken farmer. But I’m still intensely focused on some stuff. I will knock their heads off.” \n\n—Redmond is Japan markets editor for Bloomberg News in Tokyo.

In making the new recommendations for the treatment of most people with lower back pain, the group is bucking what many doctors do and changing its previous guidelines, which called for medication as first-line therapy.\n\nDr. Nitin Damle, president of the group’s board of regents and a practicing internist, said pills, even over-the-counter pain relievers and anti-inflammatories, should not be the first choice. “We need to look at therapies that are nonpharmacological first,” he said. “That is a change.”\n\nThe recommendations come as the United States is struggling with an epidemic of opioid addiction that often begins with a simple prescription for ailments like back pain. In recent years, a number of states have enacted measures aimed at curbing prescription painkillers. The problem has also led many doctors around the country to reassess prescribing practices.\n\nThe group did not address surgery. Its focus was on noninvasive treatment.\n\nThe new guidelines said that doctors should avoid prescribing opioid painkillers for relief of back pain and suggested that before patients try anti-inflammatories or muscle relaxants, they should try alternative therapies like exercise, acupuncture, massage therapy or yoga. Doctors should reassure their patients that they will get better no matter what treatment they try, the group said. The guidelines also said that steroid injections were not helpful, and neither was acetaminophen, like Tylenol, although other over-the-counter pain relievers like aspirin, naproxen or ibuprofen could provide some relief.\n\nDr. Weinstein, who was not an author of the guidelines, said patients have to stay active and wait it out. “Back pain has a natural course that does not require intervention,” he said.\n\nIn fact, for most of the people with acute back pain — defined as present for four weeks or less that does not radiate down the leg — there is no need to see a doctor at all, said Dr. Rick Deyo, a spine researcher and professor at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Ore., and an author of the new guidelines.\n\n“For acute back pain, the analogy is to the common cold,” Dr. Deyo said. “It is very common and very annoying when it happens. But most of the time it will not result in anything major or serious. ”\n\nEven those with chronic back pain — lasting at least 12 weeks — should start with nonpharmacological treatments, the guidelines say. If patients still want medication, they can try over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen or aspirin.\n\nScans, like an M.R.I., for diagnosis are worse than useless for back pain patients, members of the group said in telephone interviews. The results can be misleading, showing what look like abnormalities that actually are not related to the pain.\n\nMeasures that help patients get back to their usual routines can help along the way, as Sommer Kleweno Walley, 43, of Seattle, can attest. Last spring, she slipped on the stairs in her house and fell down hard, on her back.\n\n“After a couple of hours I could barely walk,” she said. “I was in real pain.”\n\nShe saw a physical therapist, but the pain persisted. Eleven days later, she showed up at the office of Dr. Christopher J. Standaert, a spine specialist at the University of Washington and Harborview Medical Center. She expected to receive an M.R.I., at least, and maybe a drug for pain.\n\nBut Dr. Standaert told her an M.R.I. would not make any difference in her diagnosis or recovery and that the main thing was to keep active.

The placebo effect, although modest, was about the same as the effect in studies testing nonpharmacological treatments for back pain like acupuncture, massage or chiropractic manipulations.\n\nMany people with chronic back pain tend to shut down, avoiding their usual activities, afraid of making things worse, Dr. Standaert said. Helping them is not a matter of prescribing drugs but rather teaching them to set goals and work toward returning to an active life, even if they still have pain.\n\n“They have to believe their life can get better,” Dr. Standaert said. “They have to believe they can get to a better state.”\n\nThe question is: Will the new guidelines be adopted?\n\n“Patients are looking for a cure,” said Dr. Steven J.

The guidelines also said that steroid injections were not helpful, and neither was acetaminophen, like Tylenol, although other over-the-counter pain relievers like aspirin, naproxen or ibuprofen could provide some relief.\n\nDr. Weinstein, who was not an author of the guidelines, said patients have to stay active and wait it out. “Back pain has a natural course that does not require intervention,” he said.\n\nIn fact, for most of the people with acute back pain — defined as present for four weeks or less that does not radiate down the leg — there is no need to see a doctor at all, said Dr. Rick Deyo, a spine researcher and professor at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Ore., and an author of the new guidelines.\n\n“For acute back pain, the analogy is to the common cold,” Dr. Deyo said. “It is very common and very annoying when it happens. But most of the time it will not result in anything major or serious. ”\n\nEven those with chronic back pain — lasting at least 12 weeks — should start with nonpharmacological treatments, the guidelines say. If patients still want medication, they can try over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen or aspirin.\n\nScans, like an M.R.I., for diagnosis are worse than useless for back pain patients, members of the group said in telephone interviews. The results can be misleading, showing what look like abnormalities that actually are not related to the pain.\n\nMeasures that help patients get back to their usual routines can help along the way, as Sommer Kleweno Walley, 43, of Seattle, can attest. Last spring, she slipped on the stairs in her house and fell down hard, on her back.\n\n“After a couple of hours I could barely walk,” she said. “I was in real pain.”\n\nShe saw a physical therapist, but the pain persisted. Eleven days later, she showed up at the office of Dr. Christopher J. Standaert, a spine specialist at the University of Washington and Harborview Medical Center. She expected to receive an M.R.I., at least, and maybe a drug for pain.\n\nBut Dr. Standaert told her an M.R.I. would not make any difference in her diagnosis or recovery and that the main thing was to keep active. She ended up getting anti-inflammatory medication and doing physical therapy. A few months later, her back stopped hurting.\n\nNewsletter Sign UpContinue reading the main story\nThe Well Newsletter\nGet the best of Well, with the latest on health, fitness and nutrition, delivered to your inbox every week.\n\nYou agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.\n\nIt is surprising, some experts in back pain say, how often patients are helped by treatments that are not medical, even by a placebo that patients are told at the start is really a placebo.\n\nDr. Standaert cited a study in which patients with chronic low back pain were offered a placebo, and were told it was a placebo, along with their usual treatment — often an anti-inflammatory drug like ibuprofen or naproxen. Or, the patients remained with their usual treatment alone.\n\nThose taking the placebo reported less pain and disability than those in the control group who did not take it. The placebo effect, although modest, was about the same as the effect in studies testing nonpharmacological treatments for back pain like acupuncture, massage or chiropractic manipulations.\n\nMany people with chronic back pain tend to shut down, avoiding their usual activities, afraid of making things worse, Dr. Standaert said. Helping them is not a matter of prescribing drugs but rather teaching them to set goals and work toward returning to an active life, even if they still have pain.\n\n“They have to believe their life can get better,” Dr. Standaert said. “They have to believe they can get to a better state.”\n\nThe question is: Will the new guidelines be adopted?\n\n“Patients are looking for a cure,” said Dr. Steven J. Atlas, a back pain specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital, who wrote an editorial accompanying the article on the new recommendations. “The guidelines are for managing pain.”\n\nAdded to the problem are the incentives that push doctors and patients toward medications, scans and injections, Dr. Deyo said. “There is marketing from professional organizations and from industry,” he said. “‘We have the cure. You can expect to be cured. You can expect to be pain free.’”\n\nMedical insurance also contributes to the treatment problem, back experts say, because it does not pay for remedies like mindfulness training or chiropractic manipulations which, Dr. Deyo added, “are not cheap.”\n\nEven if doctors want to recommend such treatments, there is no easy referral system, Dr. Atlas said.\n\n“It is much easier at Mass General to get a shot than to get a mind-body or cognitive behavioral therapy,” he added.\n\nDr. Weinstein has a prescription: “What we need to do is to stop medicalizing symptoms,” he said. Pills are not going to make people better and as for other treatments, he said, “yoga and tai chi, all those things are wonderful, but why not just go back to your normal activities?”\n\n“I know your back hurts, but go run, be active, instead of taking a pill.”""]]"

That’s the conclusion of a fascinating new study in mice that found that 30 minutes on a treadmill affects gene activity within cardiac cells in ways that, over the long haul, could slow the aging of the animals’ hearts.\n\nAlthough the study involved mice, the results may help to explain just how, at a cellular level, exercise improves heart health in people as well.\n\nThere’s no question that, in general, physical activity is good for hearts. Many studies have found that people who regularly exercise are much less likely to develop or die from cardiac disease than people who are sedentary.\n\nStill, researchers have remained puzzled about just how exercise alters hearts for the better. Exercise is known to improve our blood pressure, pulse rate and cholesterol profiles, all of which are associated with better cardiac health.\n\nBut many scientists who study the links between exercise and heart health have pointed out that these changes, considered together, explain only about half of the reported statistical reductions in cardiac disease and death.\n\n\nOther, more complex physiological modifications must simultaneously be taking place within the heart itself during and after exercise, these researchers have speculated.\n\nAnd recently, researchers at the University of Maryland in College Park and other institutions have begun to wonder whether some of these changes might involve telomeres.\n\nTelomeres are tiny caps on the ends of chromosomes, often compared to the tips of shoelaces, which help to prevent fraying and damage to our DNA. Young cells have relatively long telomeres. As a cell ages or undergoes significant stress, its telomeres shorten. If they become too abbreviated, the cell stops working well or dies.\n\nBut while shorter telomeres indicate biologically older cells, the process is not strictly chronological, scientists have found. Cells can age at different rates, depending on the lifestyle of the body that contains them.\n\nAerobic exercise, in particular, affects telomeres. In past studies, masters athletes have been shown to have longer telomeres in their white blood cells than sedentary people of the same chronological years, suggesting that at a cellular level, the athletes are more youthful.\n\nBut while it is easy to obtain and look inside white blood cells, far less has been known about telomeres within cardiac cells.\n\nSo for the new study, which was published this month in Experimental Physiology, the Maryland researchers and their colleagues turned to young, healthy female mice. (They chose females because they tend to run more readily than males.)\n\nThe researchers wished to see what happens inside heart muscle cells after a single workout. So they taught some of the animals how to run comfortably on small treadmills and then returned them to their cages for several days so that their bodies would lose any aerobic conditioning. Other mice remained sedentary as a control group.\n\nThen the runners were placed back on the treadmills, where they ran at a tolerable intensity (in mouse terms) for 30 minutes, a workout designed to simulate moderate exercise in people.\n\nResearchers took tissue samples of the animals’ hearts either immediately after they had finished running or an hour later, and also gathered samples from sedentary mice.\n\nThe scientists looked for changes within the animals’ cardiac cells in the levels of certain proteins that are known to directly prevent telomeres from shortening. They also looked at the activity of other genes that help to keep DNA in good repair. These genes release proteins that are thought to help cells adapt to the physiological stress of exercise and, in the process, also indirectly maintain telomere health.\n\nIt turned out that immediately after a single, 30-minute jog, the runners’ heart cells were noticeably different than those of the animals that had not moved. In particular, they showed higher levels of the proteins directly related to telomere length. These increases were slight but consistent. The runners’ cells also had markers of greater activity in the genes that respond to DNA stress than the nonrunners’ cells.\n\nThese findings indicate that a single, moderate workout beneficially alters telomere biology in the heart, says Andrew Ludlow, who was a doctoral candidate at the University of Maryland and lead author of the study. He currently is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nPresumably, such changes would accumulate with repeated training, he says, and over time help to keep cardiac telomeres longer than without the exercise.\n\nThat process could be slow, though. In this study, many of the effects seen in the animals’ hearts immediately after the run were beginning to dissipate an hour later, with protein levels dropping back almost to those seen in the sedentary mice.\n\nSo it may be necessary, Dr. Ludlow says, to stick with an exercise routine for some time in order to realize the cellular benefits for the heart.\n\nIt is also worth repeating that this study involved mice, not people.\n\nBut the implications are encouraging. It looks like getting up and moving may start to immediately change how the heart’s cells work, Dr. Ludlow says, in ways that “seem to make gene expression more youthful and keep the heart young.”""]]"

But she had a devil of a time finding one. It took weeks to track someone down, but as sad as that was, it wasn’t surprising. When it comes to lung cancer, Lucas said matter-of-factly, “there are just very few survivors.”\n\nLocated along the Kentucky River on the western side of the Appalachian Mountains, Owsley County had one of the highest percentage increases of cancer mortality per capita in the U.S. from 1980 to 2014, according to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Deaths per 100,000 people went up 45.6 percent. But this small, rural county provides just a snapshot of the larger cancer epidemic in Appalachia. According to new research out of the University of Virginia, cancer incidence has declined in much of the country since 1969 — but not in rural Appalachia. In rural Appalachian Kentucky, the cancer mortality rate is 36 percent higher than it is for urban, non-Appalachian people in the rest of the country; in rural Appalachian Virginia it is 15 percent higher; in those areas of West Virginia, 19 percent. People in much of rural Appalachia are more likely to die within three to five years of their diagnoses than those in both urban Appalachian areas and urban areas across the U.S.\n\nThe Appalachian region technically comprises all or part of 13 states, according to the Appalachian Regional Commission: Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. However, cancer clusters are often concentrated in the center, or the heart of Appalachia: southwestern Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia. Researchers say the extraordinarily high cancer rates are the result of a perfect storm of unfortunate circumstances. “On the surface, it’s lifestyle factors,” said Nengliang Yao, who led the Virginia study. But there are also economic, social and environmental factors, he said. “There are layers of risk for people to die early from cancer.”\n\nAlthough people outside of Appalachia may not know about the region’s cancer crisis, researchers and community organizations in the region have been studying and fighting cancer for decades, focusing efforts on four cancers with the highest incidence and mortality rates: lung, colorectal, cervical and breast. Unhealthy lifestyle factors undoubtedly contribute to these numbers. About 42 percent of Owsley County adults smoke, compared with about 26 percent of adults in Kentucky and 15 percent in the U.S. overall. More than 34 percent of adults in Kentucky are obese, and nearly 70 percent are overweight.\n\nAnother risk factor is pollution from strip mining and underground coal mining, though the link between environmental contaminants and cancer is less clear. Owsley County ceased commercial coal production in 2012, but according to the county, there is still funding for some smaller-scale coal production. In addition, some residents travel to nearby counties for jobs; there are still mines in operation in Breathitt County, as well as Harlan and Pike counties, which are farther east. All three of these counties are hot spots for cancer as well, according to the JAMA study.\n\nResearch out of West Virginia University has shown that mortality rates and chronic illnesses were higher in coal-producing counties, and a study comparing two West Virginia counties showed that cancer rates were 5 percentage points higher in a county with surface mining than in one without. The risk for lung cancer among coal miners who spend time underground or on strip mining operations in Appalachia is also higher. Carcinogens such as asbestos, radon, chromium and arsenic have been discovered at mining sites, in waterways and in soil in parts of Appalachia, but the source of these trace elements in people living in the area is still unknown. Environmental exposure coupled with the region’s unhealthy habits exacerbates the problem, said Thomas Tucker, associate director for cancer prevention and control at the Markey Cancer Center at the University of Kentucky. For instance, Tucker said that people who smoke are 11 to 14 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared with nonsmokers. But if they smoke and are also exposed to asbestos, their risk of developing lung cancer can be as high as 300 times that of a nonsmoker.\n\nHowever, the biggest issue, experts said, is lack of access to care — whether it’s preventive screenings or cancer treatment. If one of Owsley County’s 4,600 residents needs to visit the doctor, they have three choices: the health department or two clinics. But doctors are not always available or working, and opportunities for screening vary. For instance, mammograms are only offered once a month at the clinics, and colon cancer screenings are referred out of the county, and cervical cancer screenings are done weekly at the health department and daily at the clinic, Lucas said. The three regional hospitals are at least a 30-minute drive away on narrow, curvy mountain roads. The Markey Cancer Center in Lexington is a far drive for people in rural Appalachia.\n\nAccording to Yao, 15 percent to 20 percent of women who have abnormal mammograms don’t go back for any follow-up tests, partly because of reasons such as these. “There are a lot of barriers,” he said.\n\nSusan West Marmagas, a public health associate professor at Virginia Tech, has studied cancer in Appalachian Virginia since 2009. She said that the majority of people who are diagnosed with cancer don’t get diagnosed in the state and go to hospitals such as Duke or Wake Forest in North Carolina for treatment. In Appalachia, there often aren’t options involving advanced technology or clinical trials that can result in higher survival rates. “The other issue is late diagnosis, and so the prognosis is much worse, and survivorship is much less,” Marmagas said.\n\nWidespread poverty and lack of education make it difficult to overcome these barriers, which Appalachian counties have been battling for decades. By late 2016, there were only 3,600 coal mining jobs left in eastern Kentucky and just over 6,200 statewide, numbers not seen since the late 1800s. The tobacco industry, once thriving in Kentucky, is also gone. There’s nothing to replace these industries, so unemployment rates are some of the highest in the country. For instance, in Owsley, the rate is 9.6 percent, and median income is less than $21,000. “People don’t think a lot about their health, especially right now, with our economy,” said Ashley Teague, a regional cancer control specialist for the Kentucky Cancer Program. “They’re more worried about finding a job or can’t take time off work to get screened. It falls down on the list of priorities.”\n\nSome of these services are now covered by health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Kentucky leads the nation in the steepest decline of uninsured working-age adults, dropping from 21 percent in 2013 to 8 percent by 2015. In 2016, about 67 percent of people in Owsley County got health coverage through Medicaid, which covers preventive cancer screenings and helps cover rides to necessary treatment for people who can’t travel, Lucas said. Medicaid coverage also boosted rates of breast cancer screenings.\n\nBut still, cancer in Appalachia is an overwhelming, multi-pronged problem, researchers say, and communities know it. In a region that has been battling poverty for decades, studies and statistics don’t mean much when no real solutions are offered. “There’s a fatalism in Appalachia since everybody has family that has had cancer or died,” Marmagas said. “There’s a certain amount of ‘this is going to happen to me too,’ and they don’t get good answers from the health system around them.”\n\nBut that doesn’t keep people from trying. Dozens of groups in nearly every Appalachian county are working to raise awareness, traveling door to door, handing out take-home colon cancer screenings and driving women to get mammograms. Within the last two years, more than 6,000 people participated in these types of events for colon cancer awareness, hosted by the Kentucky Cancer Program, clinics, hospitals and health departments. According to the Kentucky Cancer Program, 92 percent of these partner organizations said events and materials increased screenings from 2015 to 2016.\n\nIt’s small victories such as those that keep Lucas and Teague going. They’ve both lived in Appalachia their entire lives and have watched neighbors, friends and family die of cancer. “We truly try hard to get the word out and work together to accomplish these goals, because our manpower and financial resources are low,” Lucas said. “Hopefully, the importance of prevention will resonate with the younger generation.”""]]"

In Appalachia, there often aren’t options involving advanced technology or clinical trials that can result in higher survival rates. “The other issue is late diagnosis, and so the prognosis is much worse, and survivorship is much less,” Marmagas said.\n\nWidespread poverty and lack of education make it difficult to overcome these barriers, which Appalachian counties have been battling for decades. By late 2016, there were only 3,600 coal mining jobs left in eastern Kentucky and just over 6,200 statewide, numbers not seen since the late 1800s. The tobacco industry, once thriving in Kentucky, is also gone. There’s nothing to replace these industries, so unemployment rates are some of the highest in the country. For instance, in Owsley, the rate is 9.6 percent, and median income is less than $21,000. “People don’t think a lot about their health, especially right now, with our economy,” said Ashley Teague, a regional cancer control specialist for the Kentucky Cancer Program. “They’re more worried about finding a job or can’t take time off work to get screened. It falls down on the list of priorities.”\n\nSome of these services are now covered by health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Kentucky leads the nation in the steepest decline of uninsured working-age adults, dropping from 21 percent in 2013 to 8 percent by 2015. In 2016, about 67 percent of people in Owsley County got health coverage through Medicaid, which covers preventive cancer screenings and helps cover rides to necessary treatment for people who can’t travel, Lucas said. Medicaid coverage also boosted rates of breast cancer screenings.\n\nBut still, cancer in Appalachia is an overwhelming, multi-pronged problem, researchers say, and communities know it. In a region that has been battling poverty for decades, studies and statistics don’t mean much when no real solutions are offered. “There’s a fatalism in Appalachia since everybody has family that has had cancer or died,” Marmagas said. “There’s a certain amount of ‘this is going to happen to me too,’ and they don’t get good answers from the health system around them.”\n\nBut that doesn’t keep people from trying. Dozens of groups in nearly every Appalachian county are working to raise awareness, traveling door to door, handing out take-home colon cancer screenings and driving women to get mammograms. Within the last two years, more than 6,000 people participated in these types of events for colon cancer awareness, hosted by the Kentucky Cancer Program, clinics, hospitals and health departments. According to the Kentucky Cancer Program, 92 percent of these partner organizations said events and materials increased screenings from 2015 to 2016.\n\nIt’s small victories such as those that keep Lucas and Teague going. They’ve both lived in Appalachia their entire lives and have watched neighbors, friends and family die of cancer. “We truly try hard to get the word out and work together to accomplish these goals, because our manpower and financial resources are low,” Lucas said. “Hopefully, the importance of prevention will resonate with the younger generation.”""]]"

But she had a devil of a time finding one. It took weeks to track someone down, but as sad as that was, it wasn’t surprising. When it comes to lung cancer, Lucas said matter-of-factly, “there are just very few survivors.”\n\nLocated along the Kentucky River on the western side of the Appalachian Mountains, Owsley County had one of the highest percentage increases of cancer mortality per capita in the U.S. from 1980 to 2014, according to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Deaths per 100,000 people went up 45.6 percent. But this small, rural county provides just a snapshot of the larger cancer epidemic in Appalachia. According to new research out of the University of Virginia, cancer incidence has declined in much of the country since 1969 — but not in rural Appalachia. In rural Appalachian Kentucky, the cancer mortality rate is 36 percent higher than it is for urban, non-Appalachian people in the rest of the country; in rural Appalachian Virginia it is 15 percent higher; in those areas of West Virginia, 19 percent. People in much of rural Appalachia are more likely to die within three to five years of their diagnoses than those in both urban Appalachian areas and urban areas across the U.S.\n\nThe Appalachian region technically comprises all or part of 13 states, according to the Appalachian Regional Commission: Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. However, cancer clusters are often concentrated in the center, or the heart of Appalachia: southwestern Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia. Researchers say the extraordinarily high cancer rates are the result of a perfect storm of unfortunate circumstances. “On the surface, it’s lifestyle factors,” said Nengliang Yao, who led the Virginia study. But there are also economic, social and environmental factors, he said. “There are layers of risk for people to die early from cancer.”\n\nAlthough people outside of Appalachia may not know about the region’s cancer crisis, researchers and community organizations in the region have been studying and fighting cancer for decades, focusing efforts on four cancers with the highest incidence and mortality rates: lung, colorectal, cervical and breast. Unhealthy lifestyle factors undoubtedly contribute to these numbers. About 42 percent of Owsley County adults smoke, compared with about 26 percent of adults in Kentucky and 15 percent in the U.S. overall. More than 34 percent of adults in Kentucky are obese, and nearly 70 percent are overweight.\n\nAnother risk factor is pollution from strip mining and underground coal mining, though the link between environmental contaminants and cancer is less clear. Owsley County ceased commercial coal production in 2012, but according to the county, there is still funding for some smaller-scale coal production. In addition, some residents travel to nearby counties for jobs; there are still mines in operation in Breathitt County, as well as Harlan and Pike counties, which are farther east. All three of these counties are hot spots for cancer as well, according to the JAMA study.\n\nResearch out of West Virginia University has shown that mortality rates and chronic illnesses were higher in coal-producing counties, and a study comparing two West Virginia counties showed that cancer rates were 5 percentage points higher in a county with surface mining than in one without. The risk for lung cancer among coal miners who spend time underground or on strip mining operations in Appalachia is also higher. Carcinogens such as asbestos, radon, chromium and arsenic have been discovered at mining sites, in waterways and in soil in parts of Appalachia, but the source of these trace elements in people living in the area is still unknown. Environmental exposure coupled with the region’s unhealthy habits exacerbates the problem, said Thomas Tucker, associate director for cancer prevention and control at the Markey Cancer Center at the University of Kentucky. For instance, Tucker said that people who smoke are 11 to 14 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared with nonsmokers. But if they smoke and are also exposed to asbestos, their risk of developing lung cancer can be as high as 300 times that of a nonsmoker.\n\nHowever, the biggest issue, experts said, is lack of access to care — whether it’s preventive screenings or cancer treatment. If one of Owsley County’s 4,600 residents needs to visit the doctor, they have three choices: the health department or two clinics. But doctors are not always available or working, and opportunities for screening vary. For instance, mammograms are only offered once a month at the clinics, and colon cancer screenings are referred out of the county, and cervical cancer screenings are done weekly at the health department and daily at the clinic, Lucas said. The three regional hospitals are at least a 30-minute drive away on narrow, curvy mountain roads. The Markey Cancer Center in Lexington is a far drive for people in rural Appalachia.\n\nAccording to Yao, 15 percent to 20 percent of women who have abnormal mammograms don’t go back for any follow-up tests, partly because of reasons such as these. “There are a lot of barriers,” he said.\n\nSusan West Marmagas, a public health associate professor at Virginia Tech, has studied cancer in Appalachian Virginia since 2009.

Karl, director of the NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\nAs described in an analysis accompanying the piece in Science, the paper dealt with an issue that deniers of anthropogenic climate change have rallied behind for years — that there has been a slowdown or “hiatus” in global warming since 1998 despite continually rising CO2 levels:\n\nPrevious analyses of global temperature trends during the first decade of the 21st century seemed to indicate that warming had stalled. This allowed critics of the idea of global warming to claim that concern about climate change was misplaced. Karl et al. now show that temperatures did not plateau as thought and that the supposed warming “hiatus” is just an artifact of earlier analyses. Warming has continued at a pace similar to that of the last half of the 20th century, and the slowdown was just an illusion.\n\nBecause of its direct attack on a talking point popular with climate change skeptics, the study has been a common target of those seeking to undermine climate science. In this latest round of controversy, the Daily Mail article cited a “whistleblower” (retired NOAA scientist John Bates) who came forward to reveal what he described as ethical lapses in the way that study’s data were selected and archived by its authors.\n\nThe allegations made against Karl and his co-authors fall into three general groups:\n\n1) That the team unethically selected flawed data that was supportive of their cause.\n\n2) That they failed to archive their data as required by both NOAA and the journal Science.\n\n3) That they rushed through the required internal review process to get the paper published before the 2015 Paris Climate Summit.\n\nFirst, and most “astonishing,” were claims that the data used in Karl’s paper were manipulated to derive a specific result, according to Rose’s Daily Mail report:\n\nThe sea dataset used by Thomas Karl and his colleagues — known as Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperatures version 4, or ERSSTv4, tripled the warming trend over the sea during the years 2000 to 2014 from just 0.036C per decade — as stated in version 3 — to 0.099C per decade …\n\nBut Dr Bates said this increase in temperatures was achieved by dubious means. Its key error was an upwards ‘adjustment’ of readings from fixed and floating buoys, which are generally reliable, to bring them into line with readings from a much more doubtful source — water taken in by ships. This, Dr Bates explained, has long been known to be questionable: ships are themselves sources of heat, readings will vary from ship to ship, and the depth of water intake will vary according to how heavily a ship is laden — so affecting temperature readings.\n\nHere, Rose offered two implications. The first was that Karl’s methodology was intentionally opaque in order to hide the fact that it went against a well-known ship measurement bias. In reality, the entire methodology was spelled out in the paper, and the ship data correction Karl et al selected had previously been published. This correction, far from ignoring the differences between boat and buoy data, actually took into account the generally superior buoy data in its calculation:\n\nSeveral studies have examined the differences between buoy- and ship-based data, noting that the ship data are systematically warmer than the buoy data. This is particularly important because much of the sea surface is now sampled by both observing systems, and surface-drifting and moored buoys have increased the overall global coverage by up to 15%. These changes have resulted in a time-dependent bias in the global SST record, and various corrections have been developed to account for the bias.\n\nRecently, a new correction [Huang et al 2015] was developed and applied in the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) data set version 4, which we used in our analysis. In essence, the bias correction involved calculating the average difference between collocated buoy and ship SSTs. The average difference globally was −0.12°C, a correction that is applied to the buoy SSTs at every grid cell in ERSST version 4. […] More generally, buoy data have been proven to be more accurate and reliable than ship data, with better-known instrument characteristics and automated sampling. Therefore, ERSST version 4 also considers this smaller buoy uncertainty in the reconstruction.\n\nConspicuously absent from Rose’s article was any mention of a 4 January 2017 study that critically investigated the choices referenced above, demonstrating that the record made by Karl et al tracked the buoy data and other modern sources of data more accurately than any other model. The lead author of that more recent study discussed those findings in response to the Daily Mail article:\n\nI recently led a team of researchers that evaluated NOAA’s updates to their ocean temperature record. In a paper published last month in the journal Science Advances, we compared the old NOAA record and the new NOAA record to independent instrumentally homogenous records created from buoys, satellite radiometers, and Argo floats. Our results, as you can see in the chart below, show that the new NOAA record agrees quite well with all of these, while the old NOAA record shows much less warming.\n\nThis was due to two factors: the old NOAA record spliced together warmer ship data with colder buoy data without accounting for the offset between the two; and the new NOAA record puts more weight on higher-quality buoy records and less weight on ship records (versus the old NOAA record which treated ships and buoys equally) …\n\nThe fact that the new NOAA record [Karl et al 2015] is effectively identical with records constructed only from higher quality instruments (buoys, satellite radiometers, and Argo floats) strongly suggests that NOAA got it right and that we have been underestimating ocean warming in recent years.\n\nThe second implication, that Karl et al intentionally selected data and corrections with the intent of exaggerating global warming, was a serious charge based only on Bates’ testimony. But in a 7 February 2016 interview with EE News, Bates explicitly stated that he did not mean to suggest that Karl et al had manipulated data:\n\nBates accused former colleagues of rushing their research to publication, in defiance of agency protocol. He specified that he did not believe that they manipulated the data upon which the research relied in any way.\n\n“The issue here is not an issue of tampering with data, but rather really of timing of a release of a paper that had not properly disclosed everything it was,” he said.\n\nWith respect to the team’s use of this new correction, Rose reported that “Dr Bates said he gave the paper’s co-authors ‘a hard time’ about this, ‘and they never really justified what they were doing.”\n\nHowever, Karl told us via e-mail that Bates’ only role in the paper was to organize the internal review process, during which time he says no such conversations regarding their use of ERSSTv4 ever took place:\n\n[There were] no discussions, nor emails to me. Dr. Bates was asked to coordinate the internal review of the paper (I am not sure who made the request) since this was normally handled by Tom Peterson, but he was one of the authors. The responsibility of the coordinator for the internal review is to identify an individual within the [National Centers for Environmental Information] who could review the paper and pass those comments back to the authors for their response. In our case, there were no comments by the reviewer.\n\n(Neither John Bates nor David Rose returned our requests for comments.)\n\nRose further alleged that Karl et al used a particular land-temperature dataset because it demonstrated findings more amenable to their cause, even though (according to Rose) that dataset was both too preliminary to be approved and was plagued by “devastating” computer bugs:\n\nThe second dataset used by the [Karl et al.] paper was a new version of NOAA’s land records, known as the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) […]. This new version found past temperatures had been cooler than previously thought, and recent ones higher — so that the warming trend looked steeper. For the period 2000 to 2014, the paper increased the rate of warming on land from 0.15C to 0.164C per decade.\n\nIn the weeks after the [Karl et al.] paper was published, Dr Bates conducted a one-man investigation into this. His findings were extraordinary. Not only had Mr Karl [sic] and his colleagues failed to follow any of the formal procedures required to approve and archive their data, they had used a ‘highly experimental early run’ of a programme that tried to combine two previously separate sets of records …\n\nAs discussed above, Bates has asserted that he did not mean to suggest Karl and his colleagues manipulated the data by selecting (as Rose implied) a new buggy model in order to exaggerate the records. Instead, Bates said that he simply felt it improper to use that data without a disclaimer clearly indicating that it was derived from an experimental run, as discussed in a blog post authored by Bates:\n\nClearly labeling the dataset would have indicated this was a highly experimental early GHCN-M version 4 run rather than a routine, operational update. As such, according to NOAA scientific integrity guidelines, it would have required a disclaimer not to use the dataset for routine monitoring.\n\nBates, it should be noted, was the lead on a massive NOAA effort that aimed to overhaul procedures for the standardization of which datasets to use, as described in that same blog post:\n\nAs a climate scientist formerly responsible for NOAA’s climate archive, the most critical issue in archival of climate data is actually scientists who are unwilling to formally archive and document their data.

Karl, director of the NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\nAs described in an analysis accompanying the piece in Science, the paper dealt with an issue that deniers of anthropogenic climate change have rallied behind for years — that there has been a slowdown or “hiatus” in global warming since 1998 despite continually rising CO2 levels:\n\nPrevious analyses of global temperature trends during the first decade of the 21st century seemed to indicate that warming had stalled. This allowed critics of the idea of global warming to claim that concern about climate change was misplaced. Karl et al. now show that temperatures did not plateau as thought and that the supposed warming “hiatus” is just an artifact of earlier analyses. Warming has continued at a pace similar to that of the last half of the 20th century, and the slowdown was just an illusion.\n\nBecause of its direct attack on a talking point popular with climate change skeptics, the study has been a common target of those seeking to undermine climate science. In this latest round of controversy, the Daily Mail article cited a “whistleblower” (retired NOAA scientist John Bates) who came forward to reveal what he described as ethical lapses in the way that study’s data were selected and archived by its authors.\n\nThe allegations made against Karl and his co-authors fall into three general groups:\n\n1) That the team unethically selected flawed data that was supportive of their cause.\n\n2) That they failed to archive their data as required by both NOAA and the journal Science.\n\n3) That they rushed through the required internal review process to get the paper published before the 2015 Paris Climate Summit.\n\nFirst, and most “astonishing,” were claims that the data used in Karl’s paper were manipulated to derive a specific result, according to Rose’s Daily Mail report:\n\nThe sea dataset used by Thomas Karl and his colleagues — known as Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperatures version 4, or ERSSTv4, tripled the warming trend over the sea during the years 2000 to 2014 from just 0.036C per decade — as stated in version 3 — to 0.099C per decade …\n\nBut Dr Bates said this increase in temperatures was achieved by dubious means. Its key error was an upwards ‘adjustment’ of readings from fixed and floating buoys, which are generally reliable, to bring them into line with readings from a much more doubtful source — water taken in by ships. This, Dr Bates explained, has long been known to be questionable: ships are themselves sources of heat, readings will vary from ship to ship, and the depth of water intake will vary according to how heavily a ship is laden — so affecting temperature readings.\n\nHere, Rose offered two implications. The first was that Karl’s methodology was intentionally opaque in order to hide the fact that it went against a well-known ship measurement bias. In reality, the entire methodology was spelled out in the paper, and the ship data correction Karl et al selected had previously been published. This correction, far from ignoring the differences between boat and buoy data, actually took into account the generally superior buoy data in its calculation:\n\nSeveral studies have examined the differences between buoy- and ship-based data, noting that the ship data are systematically warmer than the buoy data. This is particularly important because much of the sea surface is now sampled by both observing systems, and surface-drifting and moored buoys have increased the overall global coverage by up to 15%. These changes have resulted in a time-dependent bias in the global SST record, and various corrections have been developed to account for the bias.\n\nRecently, a new correction [Huang et al 2015] was developed and applied in the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) data set version 4, which we used in our analysis. In essence, the bias correction involved calculating the average difference between collocated buoy and ship SSTs. The average difference globally was −0.12°C, a correction that is applied to the buoy SSTs at every grid cell in ERSST version 4. […] More generally, buoy data have been proven to be more accurate and reliable than ship data, with better-known instrument characteristics and automated sampling. Therefore, ERSST version 4 also considers this smaller buoy uncertainty in the reconstruction.\n\nConspicuously absent from Rose’s article was any mention of a 4 January 2017 study that critically investigated the choices referenced above, demonstrating that the record made by Karl et al tracked the buoy data and other modern sources of data more accurately than any other model. The lead author of that more recent study discussed those findings in response to the Daily Mail article:\n\nI recently led a team of researchers that evaluated NOAA’s updates to their ocean temperature record. In a paper published last month in the journal Science Advances, we compared the old NOAA record and the new NOAA record to independent instrumentally homogenous records created from buoys, satellite radiometers, and Argo floats. Our results, as you can see in the chart below, show that the new NOAA record agrees quite well with all of these, while the old NOAA record shows much less warming.\n\nThis was due to two factors: the old NOAA record spliced together warmer ship data with colder buoy data without accounting for the offset between the two; and the new NOAA record puts more weight on higher-quality buoy records and less weight on ship records (versus the old NOAA record which treated ships and buoys equally) …\n\nThe fact that the new NOAA record [Karl et al 2015] is effectively identical with records constructed only from higher quality instruments (buoys, satellite radiometers, and Argo floats) strongly suggests that NOAA got it right and that we have been underestimating ocean warming in recent years.\n\nThe second implication, that Karl et al intentionally selected data and corrections with the intent of exaggerating global warming, was a serious charge based only on Bates’ testimony. But in a 7 February 2016 interview with EE News, Bates explicitly stated that he did not mean to suggest that Karl et al had manipulated data:\n\nBates accused former colleagues of rushing their research to publication, in defiance of agency protocol. He specified that he did not believe that they manipulated the data upon which the research relied in any way.\n\n“The issue here is not an issue of tampering with data, but rather really of timing of a release of a paper that had not properly disclosed everything it was,” he said.\n\nWith respect to the team’s use of this new correction, Rose reported that “Dr Bates said he gave the paper’s co-authors ‘a hard time’ about this, ‘and they never really justified what they were doing.”\n\nHowever, Karl told us via e-mail that Bates’ only role in the paper was to organize the internal review process, during which time he says no such conversations regarding their use of ERSSTv4 ever took place:\n\n[There were] no discussions, nor emails to me. Dr. Bates was asked to coordinate the internal review of the paper (I am not sure who made the request) since this was normally handled by Tom Peterson, but he was one of the authors. The responsibility of the coordinator for the internal review is to identify an individual within the [National Centers for Environmental Information] who could review the paper and pass those comments back to the authors for their response. In our case, there were no comments by the reviewer.\n\n(Neither John Bates nor David Rose returned our requests for comments.)\n\nRose further alleged that Karl et al used a particular land-temperature dataset because it demonstrated findings more amenable to their cause, even though (according to Rose) that dataset was both too preliminary to be approved and was plagued by “devastating” computer bugs:\n\nThe second dataset used by the [Karl et al.] paper was a new version of NOAA’s land records, known as the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) […]. This new version found past temperatures had been cooler than previously thought, and recent ones higher — so that the warming trend looked steeper. For the period 2000 to 2014, the paper increased the rate of warming on land from 0.15C to 0.164C per decade.\n\nIn the weeks after the [Karl et al.] paper was published, Dr Bates conducted a one-man investigation into this. His findings were extraordinary. Not only had Mr Karl [sic] and his colleagues failed to follow any of the formal procedures required to approve and archive their data, they had used a ‘highly experimental early run’ of a programme that tried to combine two previously separate sets of records …\n\nAs discussed above, Bates has asserted that he did not mean to suggest Karl and his colleagues manipulated the data by selecting (as Rose implied) a new buggy model in order to exaggerate the records. Instead, Bates said that he simply felt it improper to use that data without a disclaimer clearly indicating that it was derived from an experimental run, as discussed in a blog post authored by Bates:\n\nClearly labeling the dataset would have indicated this was a highly experimental early GHCN-M version 4 run rather than a routine, operational update. As such, according to NOAA scientific integrity guidelines, it would have required a disclaimer not to use the dataset for routine monitoring.\n\nBates, it should be noted, was the lead on a massive NOAA effort that aimed to overhaul procedures for the standardization of which datasets to use, as described in that same blog post:\n\nAs a climate scientist formerly responsible for NOAA’s climate archive, the most critical issue in archival of climate data is actually scientists who are unwilling to formally archive and document their data. I spent the last decade cajoling climate scientists to archive their data and fully document the datasets. I established a climate data records program that was awarded a U.S. Department of Commerce Gold Medal in 2014 for visionary work in the acquisition, production, and preservation of climate data records (CDRs), which accurately describe the Earth’s changing environment.\n\nIn that post, as well as in the Daily Mail piece, Bates made the claim that the use of the more experimental dataset by Karl et al contradicted NOAA policy because the new dataset had not undergone an “operational readiness review” (ORR).

Karl, director of the NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\nAs described in an analysis accompanying the piece in Science, the paper dealt with an issue that deniers of anthropogenic climate change have rallied behind for years — that there has been a slowdown or “hiatus” in global warming since 1998 despite continually rising CO2 levels:\n\nPrevious analyses of global temperature trends during the first decade of the 21st century seemed to indicate that warming had stalled. This allowed critics of the idea of global warming to claim that concern about climate change was misplaced. Karl et al. now show that temperatures did not plateau as thought and that the supposed warming “hiatus” is just an artifact of earlier analyses. Warming has continued at a pace similar to that of the last half of the 20th century, and the slowdown was just an illusion.\n\nBecause of its direct attack on a talking point popular with climate change skeptics, the study has been a common target of those seeking to undermine climate science. In this latest round of controversy, the Daily Mail article cited a “whistleblower” (retired NOAA scientist John Bates) who came forward to reveal what he described as ethical lapses in the way that study’s data were selected and archived by its authors.\n\nThe allegations made against Karl and his co-authors fall into three general groups:\n\n1) That the team unethically selected flawed data that was supportive of their cause.\n\n2) That they failed to archive their data as required by both NOAA and the journal Science.\n\n3) That they rushed through the required internal review process to get the paper published before the 2015 Paris Climate Summit.\n\nFirst, and most “astonishing,” were claims that the data used in Karl’s paper were manipulated to derive a specific result, according to Rose’s Daily Mail report:\n\nThe sea dataset used by Thomas Karl and his colleagues — known as Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperatures version 4, or ERSSTv4, tripled the warming trend over the sea during the years 2000 to 2014 from just 0.036C per decade — as stated in version 3 — to 0.099C per decade …\n\nBut Dr Bates said this increase in temperatures was achieved by dubious means. Its key error was an upwards ‘adjustment’ of readings from fixed and floating buoys, which are generally reliable, to bring them into line with readings from a much more doubtful source — water taken in by ships. This, Dr Bates explained, has long been known to be questionable: ships are themselves sources of heat, readings will vary from ship to ship, and the depth of water intake will vary according to how heavily a ship is laden — so affecting temperature readings.\n\nHere, Rose offered two implications. The first was that Karl’s methodology was intentionally opaque in order to hide the fact that it went against a well-known ship measurement bias. In reality, the entire methodology was spelled out in the paper, and the ship data correction Karl et al selected had previously been published. This correction, far from ignoring the differences between boat and buoy data, actually took into account the generally superior buoy data in its calculation:\n\nSeveral studies have examined the differences between buoy- and ship-based data, noting that the ship data are systematically warmer than the buoy data. This is particularly important because much of the sea surface is now sampled by both observing systems, and surface-drifting and moored buoys have increased the overall global coverage by up to 15%. These changes have resulted in a time-dependent bias in the global SST record, and various corrections have been developed to account for the bias.\n\nRecently, a new correction [Huang et al 2015] was developed and applied in the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) data set version 4, which we used in our analysis. In essence, the bias correction involved calculating the average difference between collocated buoy and ship SSTs. The average difference globally was −0.12°C, a correction that is applied to the buoy SSTs at every grid cell in ERSST version 4. […] More generally, buoy data have been proven to be more accurate and reliable than ship data, with better-known instrument characteristics and automated sampling. Therefore, ERSST version 4 also considers this smaller buoy uncertainty in the reconstruction.\n\nConspicuously absent from Rose’s article was any mention of a 4 January 2017 study that critically investigated the choices referenced above, demonstrating that the record made by Karl et al tracked the buoy data and other modern sources of data more accurately than any other model. The lead author of that more recent study discussed those findings in response to the Daily Mail article:\n\nI recently led a team of researchers that evaluated NOAA’s updates to their ocean temperature record. In a paper published last month in the journal Science Advances, we compared the old NOAA record and the new NOAA record to independent instrumentally homogenous records created from buoys, satellite radiometers, and Argo floats. Our results, as you can see in the chart below, show that the new NOAA record agrees quite well with all of these, while the old NOAA record shows much less warming.\n\nThis was due to two factors: the old NOAA record spliced together warmer ship data with colder buoy data without accounting for the offset between the two; and the new NOAA record puts more weight on higher-quality buoy records and less weight on ship records (versus the old NOAA record which treated ships and buoys equally) …\n\nThe fact that the new NOAA record [Karl et al 2015] is effectively identical with records constructed only from higher quality instruments (buoys, satellite radiometers, and Argo floats) strongly suggests that NOAA got it right and that we have been underestimating ocean warming in recent years.\n\nThe second implication, that Karl et al intentionally selected data and corrections with the intent of exaggerating global warming, was a serious charge based only on Bates’ testimony. But in a 7 February 2016 interview with EE News, Bates explicitly stated that he did not mean to suggest that Karl et al had manipulated data:\n\nBates accused former colleagues of rushing their research to publication, in defiance of agency protocol. He specified that he did not believe that they manipulated the data upon which the research relied in any way.\n\n“The issue here is not an issue of tampering with data, but rather really of timing of a release of a paper that had not properly disclosed everything it was,” he said.\n\nWith respect to the team’s use of this new correction, Rose reported that “Dr Bates said he gave the paper’s co-authors ‘a hard time’ about this, ‘and they never really justified what they were doing.”\n\nHowever, Karl told us via e-mail that Bates’ only role in the paper was to organize the internal review process, during which time he says no such conversations regarding their use of ERSSTv4 ever took place:\n\n[There were] no discussions, nor emails to me. Dr. Bates was asked to coordinate the internal review of the paper (I am not sure who made the request) since this was normally handled by Tom Peterson, but he was one of the authors. The responsibility of the coordinator for the internal review is to identify an individual within the [National Centers for Environmental Information] who could review the paper and pass those comments back to the authors for their response. In our case, there were no comments by the reviewer.\n\n(Neither John Bates nor David Rose returned our requests for comments.)\n\nRose further alleged that Karl et al used a particular land-temperature dataset because it demonstrated findings more amenable to their cause, even though (according to Rose) that dataset was both too preliminary to be approved and was plagued by “devastating” computer bugs:\n\nThe second dataset used by the [Karl et al.] paper was a new version of NOAA’s land records, known as the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) […]. This new version found past temperatures had been cooler than previously thought, and recent ones higher — so that the warming trend looked steeper. For the period 2000 to 2014, the paper increased the rate of warming on land from 0.15C to 0.164C per decade.\n\nIn the weeks after the [Karl et al.] paper was published, Dr Bates conducted a one-man investigation into this. His findings were extraordinary. Not only had Mr Karl [sic] and his colleagues failed to follow any of the formal procedures required to approve and archive their data, they had used a ‘highly experimental early run’ of a programme that tried to combine two previously separate sets of records …\n\nAs discussed above, Bates has asserted that he did not mean to suggest Karl and his colleagues manipulated the data by selecting (as Rose implied) a new buggy model in order to exaggerate the records. Instead, Bates said that he simply felt it improper to use that data without a disclaimer clearly indicating that it was derived from an experimental run, as discussed in a blog post authored by Bates:\n\nClearly labeling the dataset would have indicated this was a highly experimental early GHCN-M version 4 run rather than a routine, operational update. As such, according to NOAA scientific integrity guidelines, it would have required a disclaimer not to use the dataset for routine monitoring.\n\nBates, it should be noted, was the lead on a massive NOAA effort that aimed to overhaul procedures for the standardization of which datasets to use, as described in that same blog post:\n\nAs a climate scientist formerly responsible for NOAA’s climate archive, the most critical issue in archival of climate data is actually scientists who are unwilling to formally archive and document their data. I spent the last decade cajoling climate scientists to archive their data and fully document the datasets. I established a climate data records program that was awarded a U.S. Department of Commerce Gold Medal in 2014 for visionary work in the acquisition, production, and preservation of climate data records (CDRs), which accurately describe the Earth’s changing environment.\n\nIn that post, as well as in the Daily Mail piece, Bates made the claim that the use of the more experimental dataset by Karl et al contradicted NOAA policy because the new dataset had not undergone an “operational readiness review” (ORR). He also alleged that the use of this data set, and a computer failure, resulted in no record being created of what the paper’s authors did, putting that paper in conflict with both Science’s editorial standards and NOAA’s internal standards — a point Rose brought up multiple times:\n\nThe lack of archival of the GHCN-M V3.X [their experimental version of the land temperature data] and the global merged product is also in violation of Science policy on making data available. This policy states: “Climate data. Data should be archived in the NOAA climate repository or other public databases”. Did Karl et al. disclose to Science Magazine that they would not be following the NOAA archive policy, would not archive the data, and would only provide access to a non-machine readable version only on an FTP server?\n\nZeke Hausfather, the lead author on a 2017 study that looked into Karl et al’s use of this data, disputed Rose’s characterization:\n\nIn his [Daily Mail] article, David Rose relies on reports from a researcher at NOAA who was unhappy about the data archiving associated with the Karl et al paper.

Understanding why is key to solving the crisis.\nHow doctors prescribe opioids varies — and unlucky patients end up getting hooked.\nAUTHOR: By Julia Belluz@juliaoftorontojulia.belluz@voxmedia.com  \nDATE: Feb 16, 2017, 7:30am EST\n\nPatients who, by chance, saw a doctor that more frequently prescribed opioids were 30 percent more likely to become long-term users of painkillers. Priscilla Prentice/Shutterstock\nThere’s a huge amount of discussion these days about the opioid epidemic in America: how the overdose rate got so shockingly high and what should be done to stop it.\n\nA common belief is that opioid addiction often begins with a single prescription from a doctor: Patients seek relief from some minor problem like a toothache or back pain, leave with a prescription, and wind up hooked.\n\nBut there’s not much actual evidence tying doctors’ prescription patterns to individual patients’ long-term use of opioids or complications caused by the drugs later on.\n\nIn a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers tried to tease out that link. And they found doctors’ prescribing habits — whether they give out opioids at a higher rate versus a lower rate — matter a lot.\n\nFor the study, researchers from Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of  Public Health looked at 375,000 Medicare patients who turned up in an emergency department for common reasons — such as falls, chest pain, ankle sprain, or back pain — and hadn’t used opioids in the six months before their hospital stay.\n\nThe study authors then split the group into patients who happened to be assigned to doctors who prescribed a lot of opioids, and patients who met doctors who didn’t. This was a clever study design, since the major difference between the groups was how the doctors prescribed opioids, which allowed the researchers to figure out whether the prescribing patterns influenced patients’ long-term use of painkillers. (In the study, “long-term use” was described as six or more months of daily opioids in the 12-month period following the ER visit.)\n\nIt turns out the doctors’ actions mattered hugely. The patients who saw the heavy opioid prescribers were three times more likely to receive a prescription for opioids compared with the patients who saw the more judicious opioid prescribers at the same hospital. The high prescribers doled out opioids to a quarter of their patients, while the more conservative prescribers only treated 7 percent with opioids on average, a variation the researchers thought was likely the result of inappropriate prescribing.\n\n\n“If our results represent a causal relationship, for every 48 patients prescribed a new opioid in the emergency department who might not otherwise use opioids, 1 will become a long-term user,” the researchers wrote.\n\nWhat’s more, the patients who, by chance, saw a doctor who more frequently prescribed the drugs were 30 percent more likely to become long-term users of painkillers. So the higher the chances of getting opioids at a single doctor visit, the higher the risk of becoming a regular user. These patients also had higher rates of opioid-related health complications like falls, fractures, constipation, and overdoses.\n\nIn a separate analysis, the researchers looked at doctors who gave out high doses versus low doses of painkillers when they prescribe, and found the same effect: 30 percent higher use when patients saw higher dose prescribers, though the researchers also acknowledged this long-term use required prescriptions from other doctors after the ER visit.\n\n“When it comes to opioids, it certainly seems to be the case that [the doctor] you see matters,” said Anupam Jena, a professor at Harvard Medical School and an author on the study.\n\nHe and his co-authors tried to figure out what caused some doctors to prescribe more than others, looking at details like age, gender, and where the doctor trained — but they didn’t find much. “It could be something as simple as prescribing the way that your mentors prescribed when you were training,” Jena explained.\n\nThe research highlights the need to better educate doctors on how to safely prescribe these drugs, said lead  study author Michael  Barnett, an assistant professor of health policy and management at Harvard. There’s very little guidance in training and in medical practice on how much opioids to prescribe — which is why the profession is now galvanizing to change that.\n\nThe findings were specific to emergency room doctors and Medicare recipients. But other researchers have found that in terms of sheer volume, family practice and internal medicine doctors, as well as nurse practitioners and physician assistants, prescribed the most opioids. ER doctors aren’t the heaviest opioid prescribers, as you can see in this chart of prescriptions per doctor.

And they found doctors’ prescribing habits — whether they give out opioids at a higher rate versus a lower rate — matter a lot.\n\nFor the study, researchers from Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of  Public Health looked at 375,000 Medicare patients who turned up in an emergency department for common reasons — such as falls, chest pain, ankle sprain, or back pain — and hadn’t used opioids in the six months before their hospital stay.\n\nThe study authors then split the group into patients who happened to be assigned to doctors who prescribed a lot of opioids, and patients who met doctors who didn’t.

The patients who saw the heavy opioid prescribers were three times more likely to receive a prescription for opioids compared with the patients who saw the more judicious opioid prescribers at the same hospital. The high prescribers doled out opioids to a quarter of their patients, while the more conservative prescribers only treated 7 percent with opioids on average, a variation the researchers thought was likely the result of inappropriate prescribing.\n\n\n“If our results represent a causal relationship, for every 48 patients prescribed a new opioid in the emergency department who might not otherwise use opioids, 1 will become a long-term user,” the researchers wrote.\n\nWhat’s more, the patients who, by chance, saw a doctor who more frequently prescribed the drugs were 30 percent more likely to become long-term users of painkillers. So the higher the chances of getting opioids at a single doctor visit, the higher the risk of becoming a regular user. These patients also had higher rates of opioid-related health complications like falls, fractures, constipation, and overdoses.\n\nIn a separate analysis, the researchers looked at doctors who gave out high doses versus low doses of painkillers when they prescribe, and found the same effect: 30 percent higher use when patients saw higher dose prescribers, though the researchers also acknowledged this long-term use required prescriptions from other doctors after the ER visit.\n\n“When it comes to opioids, it certainly seems to be the case that [the doctor] you see matters,” said Anupam Jena, a professor at Harvard Medical School and an author on the study.\n\nHe and his co-authors tried to figure out what caused some doctors to prescribe more than others, looking at details like age, gender, and where the doctor trained — but they didn’t find much. “It could be something as simple as prescribing the way that your mentors prescribed when you were training,” Jena explained.\n\nThe research highlights the need to better educate doctors on how to safely prescribe these drugs, said lead  study author Michael  Barnett, an assistant professor of health policy and management at Harvard. There’s very little guidance in training and in medical practice on how much opioids to prescribe — which is why the profession is now galvanizing to change that.\n\nThe findings were specific to emergency room doctors and Medicare recipients.

After 12 hours, the body begins burning fat stores, Peterson said. [Dieters, Beware: 9 Myths That Can Make You Fat]\n\nHowever, Peterson cautioned that burning 6 percent more fat did not meet the researchers' criteria for a meaningful difference between the groups. That means the difference could have been due to chance, and in scientific terms, the finding was not \""statistically significant.\"" But this could also be because the study was too small to show a meaningful difference between the groups, Peterson said. So, a larger study would be needed to confirm these preliminary findings, she said.\n\nDr. Alexandra Johnstone, a senior research fellow at the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, who was not involved with the study, noted that any differences in fat-burning seen in the study are likely because people in the fasting group went all evening and night (18 hours) without eating. But these differences should not be taken to mean that eating food like carbs after a certain time can lead to increased fat production, she said.\n\nIn the study, which was presented at the Obesity Society Annual Meeting in late 2016, 11 overweight individuals ages 20 to 45 years took part in two different weeklong phases of the experiment. For one trial, participants would begin, on day 4 of the week, to consume all of their calories between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. In the control trial, participants would, also on day 4, start consuming all of their calories between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Each participant took part in both trials.\n\nWhile the study found no difference in weight loss between the two trials, Peterson said that there was a nearly 13-hour period, mostly at night, when fat-burning levels were elevated in participants who ate their calories within the 6-hour window.\n\nBesides the increased fat-burning, the study also found that hunger levels were more stable for participants who ate their daily calories within the 6-hour window versus the 12-hour window. Researchers used an arbitrary 100-point scale and asked participants to rate their hunger, with a score of 100 being the highest and 0 the lowest, in each phase of the trial. Results showed that, while average hunger levels were the same for both groups, the group eating all calories within the 6-hour window had hunger levels that varied by 12 fewer points than the group eating all their calories within the 12-hour window.\n\nThis may be because those waiting until later in the day to consume their dinner meal still had a third of their calories left to consume, Peterson said. \""That might set you up more for binges or unhealthy eating than if you've already eaten all of your food for the day,\"" Peterson said, though she added that more research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nFor people hoping to try fasting, Peterson recommended starting with a 9-hour window of food consumption and gradually working that down to 8, 7 and finally 6 hours.\n\nHowever, this type of fasting should be avoided for children and women who are pregnant, Peterson said. That's because fasting slows down the rate that cells are dividing, which could harm growing children or fetuses, Peterson noted. She also emphasized that anyone with a major chronic disease would need to talk to a doctor before attempting a fasting regimen. Finally, whether such fasting helps with long-term weight loss is still unknown, the researchers said.\n\nPeterson said she hopes to not only repeat the study with a larger sample size, but also test whether time of day affects fat-burning levels. For instance, she might compare participants who eat their calories in a 6-hour window in the morning against those who do so in a 6-hour window in the evening.""]]"

So, a larger study would be needed to confirm these preliminary findings, she said.\n\nDr. Alexandra Johnstone, a senior research fellow at the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, who was not involved with the study, noted that any differences in fat-burning seen in the study are likely because people in the fasting group went all evening and night (18 hours) without eating. But these differences should not be taken to mean that eating food like carbs after a certain time can lead to increased fat production, she said.\n\nIn the study, which was presented at the Obesity Society Annual Meeting in late 2016, 11 overweight individuals ages 20 to 45 years took part in two different weeklong phases of the experiment. For one trial, participants would begin, on day 4 of the week, to consume all of their calories between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. In the control trial, participants would, also on day 4, start consuming all of their calories between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Each participant took part in both trials.\n\nWhile the study found no difference in weight loss between the two trials, Peterson said that there was a nearly 13-hour period, mostly at night, when fat-burning levels were elevated in participants who ate their calories within the 6-hour window.\n\nBesides the increased fat-burning, the study also found that hunger levels were more stable for participants who ate their daily calories within the 6-hour window versus the 12-hour window. Researchers used an arbitrary 100-point scale and asked participants to rate their hunger, with a score of 100 being the highest and 0 the lowest, in each phase of the trial. Results showed that, while average hunger levels were the same for both groups, the group eating all calories within the 6-hour window had hunger levels that varied by 12 fewer points than the group eating all their calories within the 12-hour window.\n\nThis may be because those waiting until later in the day to consume their dinner meal still had a third of their calories left to consume, Peterson said. \""That might set you up more for binges or unhealthy eating than if you've already eaten all of your food for the day,\"" Peterson said, though she added that more research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nFor people hoping to try fasting, Peterson recommended starting with a 9-hour window of food consumption and gradually working that down to 8, 7 and finally 6 hours.\n\nHowever, this type of fasting should be avoided for children and women who are pregnant, Peterson said. That's because fasting slows down the rate that cells are dividing, which could harm growing children or fetuses, Peterson noted. She also emphasized that anyone with a major chronic disease would need to talk to a doctor before attempting a fasting regimen. Finally, whether such fasting helps with long-term weight loss is still unknown, the researchers said.\n\nPeterson said she hopes to not only repeat the study with a larger sample size, but also test whether time of day affects fat-burning levels. For instance, she might compare participants who eat their calories in a 6-hour window in the morning against those who do so in a 6-hour window in the evening.""]]"

NASA]\n\nAt the end of 2015, Congress gave NASA a big directive: develop a spacecraft that can land on Jupiter’s moon Europa — an icy world that is thought to harbor a saltwater ocean underneath its surface. Because of the likelihood of liquid water on Europa, the moon has become an enticing place of study for researchers and is considered a top candidate in the search for alien life in our Solar System. And now, thanks to the will of Congress, NASA has come up with a mission concept for landing on Europa, as well as the top scientific goals of such a project. The main priority? Figuring out if we’re alone out here.\n\nTHE MAIN PRIORITY? FIGURING OUT IF WE’RE ALONE OUT HERE\nBefore the Congressional directive, NASA had already been developing a mission that would send a spacecraft to explore Europa. Called the Europa Clipper mission, it envisioned putting a vehicle in orbit around Jupiter. The spacecraft would then periodically fly close to Europa, gather data about the moon, and then fly back out again. However, the mission does not call for the vehicle to actually land on Europa’s surface.\n\nIt seemed that such a concept was not ambitious enough for Congress, particularly for one representative John Culberson (R-TX), who has been a driving force behind a mission to the moon, according to Ars Technica. So included in a massive omnibus bill that funded the government for fiscal year 2016, Congress told NASA to develop a Europa orbiter and lander, both of which are meant to launch on the space agency’s future rocket, the Space Launch System, sometime in the 2020s.\n\nAfter that bill was passed, NASA put together a Science Definition Team, which convened in June to discuss a feasible lander mission and what the top science goals of such a program would be. That team’s report has now been delivered to NASA, and it defines three key goals of a Europa lander, the first of which is seemingly obvious: look for evidence of life. Since liquid water is essential for supporting life on our planet, scientists think that Europa’s subsurface ocean may help support life on the moon as well. Plus, there’s speculation that Europa’s ocean may be twice the size of all the oceans on Earth. This water is also thought to come in contact with a heated rocky seafloor, and the interactions between the liquid and the rock may provide the right amount of energy needed to support microbial life.\n\n\n[Jupiter’s moon Europa. Photo: NASA]\n\nThe second goal defined in the report is to assess Europa’s habitability. Even if signs of life aren’t found, the lander could determine if it’s even possible for organisms to live on the moon’s surface or subsurface. Finally, the third goal is to figure out if Europa could support future, more ambitious missions. For instance, NASA would like to know if it’s possible for a spacecraft to go deeper inside the icy shell the covers the ocean, or perhaps a vehicle could dip into the water.\n\n\nThe report clarifies that this lander is meant to be separate from the Europa Clipper mission, so it would travel on its own to the moon. The team also lays out the complex way in which the lander will get to Jupiter and then touch down on Europa’s surface. Seeing as how the moon doesn’t have an atmosphere, the lander won’t need a heat shield for protection. The lander also won’t use a parachute to slow itself down, but will instead use a combination of its engine and a sky crane — similar to the one used by NASA’s Curiosity rover — to lower down to Europa’s surface. And the entire process will have to be automated too, given how far Europa is from Earth.\n\nTHE LANDER WILL HAVE A SUITE OF INSTRUMENTS DESIGNED TO LOOK FOR LIFE AND ASSESS EUROPA’S HABITABILITY\nOnce on the surface, the lander will have a suite of instruments designed to look for life and assess Europa’s habitability. It’s the first time NASA has developed a life-detection system of this kind since the Viking spacecraft, which the space agency sent to Mars in the 1970s. The Europa lander will include instruments like an Organic Compositional Analyzer, tasked with looking for organic compounds like amino acids, lipids, and more. The vehicle will also be equipped with a microscope, which can look for microbial cells less than 0.2 microns in diameter.\n\nThe full details of the instruments and goals of the lander are in NASA’s Europa report. NASA will also be discussing the new lander concept at two upcoming town hall meetings in March and April.""]]"

Known as 压岁钱 (yāsuìqían, \""money against misfortune\"") when given to children or simply 红包 (hóngbāo, \""red envelope\"" or \""red pocket\""), after the festive wrapping in which the money is presented, the many prescribed rules of giving and receiving these cash offerings are a bulwark of the Confucian family hierarchy as well as a source of anxiety to cash-strapped people with big families everywhere.\n\nIt used to be difficult to estimate how much money was changing hands every Spring Festival through hongbao—but as mobile applications like WeChat, QQ, and Alipay started to add hongbao-payment to their services, we start to get clearer pictures of just how widespread is the practice. Note that online and offline hongbao trends are not always equivalent; the big cash gifts prepared for close relatives are still traditionally exchanged offline, though increasingly through payment platforms like Alipay. On the other hand, hongbao sent through social media-oriented mobile apps tend to be token offerings to friends and acquaintances or prizes for other members of your WeChat groups to \""snatch\"" before the total runs out. This year, WeChat reports that 46 billion hongbao transactions took place through its platform between the Lunar New Year's Eve and fifth day of the New Year (January 27 – February 1), a 43 percent increase from last year, with an average of 37 hongbao transactions per user.\n\nThough WeChat has never revealed how much money has changed hands in total during each Spring Festival, Alipay reported last year 250 million hongbao were sent through its payment system on New Year's Eve had an average of 182.6 RMB. In sum, there's a lot of money changing hands all around the nation, which provides us a fount of economic information. Here are a few economic implications drawn from hongbao-giving.\n\n1. The value of hongbao transactions relates to regional economic conditions…except when it doesn't\n\nFor traditional, offline gifts of hongbao, self-reporting is still the primary means of locating patterns and trends in the numbers of hongbao exchanged, the socially acceptable value per hongbao, and average haul per person in each region of China. Over the past week, an essay circulating on WeChat titled \""People in Guangdong Still Give Out 5 RMB Hongbao\"" inspired netizens around China to \""air out\"" (晒)—that is, share with their social networks—the typical value of hongbao given in their home region.\n\nAs summarized by the public WeChat account Panyu WeChat By Data, the Yangtze River Delta region (comprising Shanghai and parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces), an economic powerhouse region stereotyped as the home of the nouveau riche, had the highest self-reported starting value of hongbao in the nation: four figures for close relatives, hundreds among friends, with some households reporting five-figure hongbao from direct senior relatives and myth-shrouded six or seven figures among the tuhao. However, any expected correlation between the hongbao largesse and general economic prowess of a region ends after this promising start, as it's economically depressed northeastern (Dongbei) and northwestern (Xibei) China that claim the next spots, with hongbao starting at 100 for acquaintances, several hundred for other relatives or close friends, and going into four figures when giving to younger, close relatives.\n\nOn the other hand, as the title of the WeChat essay indicates, the province with the highest GDP also gives the smallest hongbao in China. In response to the essay, Guangdong natives matter-of-factly informed the rest of us that it's simply the cultural practice in their region to give small, token hongbao, but give them to a lot of people: 5 or 10 RMB among acquaintances, 20 RMB among close friends or relatives, and a maximum of around 100 RMB from the closest relatives. The money is referred to as 利是 (lìshì, or lai si in Cantonese) and is given not only to relatives who've net yet entered the workforce, the elderly, or close friends as in other parts of China, but pretty much anyone you know who is unmarried. Happily, rather than be disparaged for their perceived stinginess, these Guangzhou residents received positive comments from netizens in other provinces regarding their strong regional identity and lack of pollution by the materialism of the rest of the country.\n\nNetizens from Dongbei also tried to justify their hongbao amounts on cultural grounds—by owning their reputation as a hale and hearty people who like to do everything, but especially the Spring Festival, enthusiastically. Additionally, the self-reports of netizens indicated variation within each region, and some were not expected to give as large a hongbao as typical of their region due to young age or lack of seniority in the family or because they've just joined the workforce. Conversely, they have to give more than normal if they've come into good fortune, such as an impending marriage or birth of a child. The value of hongbao also varies according to your relationship with the person and their immediate family members in the context of the whole clan (for example, an older brother might give a larger hongbao to a younger brother's children than vice versa), whether you see the relative every Spring Festival or just now and then, and if they've achieved some milestone event such as starting university.\n\nThough there's no direct correlation between a region's economic conditions and hongbao, it might be fairer to hypothesize based on these reports that economic conditions personal, familial, and regional are some of the forces determining the general amount of hongbao given, but may be influenced by less rational factors like cultural prescription, emotional distance, and status.\n\n2. Taxing corporate hongbao is a huge headache—yes, this is taxed\n\nHongbao exchanged between individuals—received from your grandparents, or given to your second cousin's spouse's niece who just happened to be visiting and would feel left out—is not taxed. However, if a corporation gives out hongbao, it's taxed at 20 percent. Non-cash gifts get to bypass the tax requirements, so many employees end up bearing home gift certificates or boxes of food, condiments, and cooking oil as their Spring Festival bonus from the company.\n\nHowever, the advent of electronic hongbao opens another can of worms. In 2015, China amended its tax policies to clearly state that e-hongbao sent from a corporation to an individual should also be taxed. An example cited by the law is the practice of TV stations giving out hongbao in the course of their Spring Festival galas to viewers over WeChat as a promotional tactic; according to the new law, the taxed amount should be taken out of the amount given out to the winner, similar with lottery earnings. This law is, needless to say, controversial and very hard to enforce, complicated especially by the practice of some corporations to give out hongbao their followers on their WeChat accounts in negligible amounts that are not worth the cost of actually collecting the tax.\n\n3. Hongbao-speak in the stock market\n\nIn Chinese, the term \""hongbao market\"" (红包行情) refers to a surge—usually more than 10 percent—in stock prices that takes place close to the Spring Festival, as if giving stockholders a big hongbao. This is explained by people traditionally wanting to keep hold their money (and by extension other assets) during the New Year. Stockholders, likewise, are averse to selling. During the Spring Festival of 2016, the first after China's stock market bubble burst in the summer of 2015, stockholders and analysts nervously watched to see whether tradition or panic would rule the day. In the end, to great fanfare, there was a 10.5 percent surge for the two weeks before and after the Spring Festival. Analysts still cautioned people not to celebrate too early: just as the panic before the Spring Festival is not entirely based on rational decision-making, the hongbao market is also a product of culture and emotion, thus not an indicator for the overall recovery of the stock market.\n\n4. Mobile hongbao: the new frontier in economic data\n\nOn the e-hongbao front, more definitive rankings emerge as to the top hongbao-giving provinces in the nation. In terms of amount of hongbao sent over WeChat, Guangdong topped the list with 5.84 billion hongbao sent and received this year, followed by Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, and Zhejiang. This is almost consistent with the country's top five provinces by GDP: Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang, and Henan. However, the correlation should be taken with some caveats, as the general practice of sending WeChat hongbao—small amounts to many people—is similar to physical hongbao-giving practices reported by Guangdong residents on WeChat.\n\nSo far, most of the analysis done regarding hongbao data collected by WeChat and Alipay have been in the realm of trivia: this year, for example, it was revealed that the greatest number of WeChat hongbao transactions were made from Guangdong to Hunan province, followed by Hunan to Guangdong, Guangdong to Guangxi, Guangxi to Guangdong, and Beijing to Hebei—possibly mirroring the economic relationship between these regions. The post-80s generation also exchanged the most WeChat hongbao among themselves, followed by the post-90s-to-post-90s generation and post-80s-to-post-90s generation. It was also determined that men gave more WeChat hongbao than women to recipients of both sexes: 32.4 percent of hongbao were exchanged between men compared to 25.5 percent between women, and 24.6 percent were given by men to women compared to 17.5 percent the other way around.\n\nWith such a wealth of data waiting to be mined, it's no wonder that the Chinese authorities are relying on mobile payment systems to finally create some sort of credit-rating system for the nation.\n\nAnd here's what TWOC staff had to say about hongbao practices in their home region:\n\nJiahui, editor (Liaoning, northeastern China) The absolute minimum is 100 RMB, but that's considered stingy. Give in the hundreds for kids who are related to you, but for hongbao from older relatives closely related to you, it's in the four figures. It varies according to family and how many children they have. Also, grandparents tend to give a lot in general.\n\nJane, distribution (Heilongjiang, northeastern China) The minimum should be 500 RMB, but there are lots of considerations such as how many children the family has, whether their parents are more or less senior than you, and if their immediate family just experienced a milestone event like a wedding.\n\nTao, art director (Beijing/Liaoning, northeastern China) I am from a smaller place than Jianhui. It's 100 for distant relatives, 200-300 for close relatives. In Beijing, it starts at 500 RMB for close relatives.\n\nMengxi, marketing (Hunan, south-central China) Four figures, and it keeps going up. Also, I'm told that if you give a hongbao back to somebody who gave one to you, you have to give more than you received, so you have to give a decent amount but not too much; that's probably why the amount keeps going up.\n\nHatty, editor (Jiangxi, southeastern China) Older, close relatives give between 1000 and 2000 RMB, but 300-500 is considered a good amount for younger, unmarried family members to give out. The amount is 2000-5000 RMB from older relatives for major milestones or children they haven't seen in a long time.\n\nJue, editorial director (Inner Mongolia, northwestern China) 200-500? It varies too much. Best thing to do is ask your mother what the appropriate amount is, or consult beforehand with other relatives of your generation so you all give a similar amount.\n\nSo how much did you give out, rake in, or \""snatch\"" on WeChat this year?""]]"

Different bioclimatic models can produce highly variable predictions of species-range shifts (7–11), and there is a poor correlation between a model’s ability to fit present and future distributions (12). For example, Pearson et al. (9) applied nine bioclimatic models to predict the distributions of four South African plants under current and future climates. Predicted distribution changes varied from 92% loss to 322% gain for one species; similar variability was recorded for the other species. In another study, observed and predicted changes in the distributions of British breeding birds differed markedly for 90% of the 116 birds modeled (see the figure) (8). \n\nEvaluating model performance under climate change requires a paradigm shift, because there are no data against which predictions of future ranges can be tested (12). One way to overcome this problem is to make use of backward predictions, or “hindcasting.” Here, models are calibrated with current species-climate relationships and are then tested with reconstructed species distributions from the fossil record. This approach has been used to test whether climatic requirements of species remain stable over time (13, 14). However, hindcasting is only feasible for a few species and regions for which a good fossil record is available. \n\nThe predictive ability of models can also be tested through “space-for-time” substitution. Here, bioclimatic models are calibrated with data from one region, and predictions are tested with distributions of species from other regions. Randin et al. recently illustrated the principle by predicting plant species distributions in the Austrian Alps based on knowledge of species-climate relationships in the Swiss Alps and vice versa (15). They found that predictions from generalized linear models (which impose a theoretical response curve) were more easily transferable in space and time than generalized additive models (which produce data-driven response curves). However, the latter yielded more precise predictions in the regions where the models had been calibrated. \n\nDo data-driven, machine-learning, and community models provide more precise predictions of species distributions in a given region because they overfit the data? Does model precision come at the expense of generality, that is, the ability to predict species distributions in different regions or times?

The results of the two studies (6, 15) call for a second generation of studies to test predictions of bioclimatic models under climate change. \n\nPredictions of future distributions of species from bioclimatic models may fail because of uncertain predictions of local climate change, inaccurate estimates of the climatic tolerance of species, and unforeseen evolutionary changes in populations (16).

Maybe a child isn’t making eye contact, or won’t smile when mom or dad walks in the door.\n\nBut a new study suggests there is evidence of autism in the brain even earlier—well before a child’s first birthday—and that the signs can be seen on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. “We’re learning that there are biological changes that occur at [the time] or before the symptoms start to emerge,” says Geraldine Dawson, a clinical psychologist and autism researcher at Duke University who was not involved in the new work. “It’s the ability to detect autism at its very earliest stages that’s going to allow us to intervene before the full syndrome is manifest.”\n\nFor the study, published this week in Nature, researchers conducted MRI scans on 150 children three times: at six months old, one year and two years. Just over 100 of the children were at high risk because they had an older sibling diagnosed with autism. The faster growth rate of the surface areas of their brains correctly predicted eight times out of 10 which of the high-risk children would go on to be diagnosed with the condition.\n\nEnlargement of the brain seemed to correlate with the arrival of symptoms, says Heather Hazlett, a psychologist at the University of North Carolina’s Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities (CIDD), and the paper’s lead author. Still, with only 100 at-risk children, the study is too small to be considered definitive—nor should doctors rush to use MRIs to diagnose autism, Hazlett says.\n\nBut if the study results are confirmed in future research, it could offer a new option for screening high-risk children before their symptoms become obvious—and possibly at a time when treatment will be most effective. The faster pattern of brain growth “is a potential biomarker that could be used to identify those infants who perhaps could benefit from early stimulation,” Dawson says. \""This could help those children have the best outcomes.”\n\nAutism spectrum disorders—so called because they present a wide range, or spectrum, of different social and communication challenges—are often characterized by behaviors that include rocking motions or obsessions. Parents often do not notice things that would point to an autism diagnosis until about 18 months, when typical children are expected to be talking and interacting socially. By showing the child’s neurobiology changes before behavior does, the study may help parents better understand their child’s experience, says biopsychologist Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, a nonprofit that supports research but was not involved in the new work.\n\nBy showing scientists more about how brains develop prior to an autism diagnosis, the study may also offer insights into the genetic triggers of autism, says James McPartland, a psychologist at Yale University’s Child Study Center who also did not take part in the research. “When we know more about neural pathways, we can think more about the genetic pathways,” he says.\n\nOne thing the study could not show is whether there is anything different about the autism in families that have more than one child with the condition, compared with autism that seems to have no familial connection. One in every 68 children is diagnosed with autism; but among the younger siblings of a child on the spectrum, the rate is as high as one in five.\n\nA number of studies are underway among these younger siblings of children on the spectrum, often called “baby sibs,” who are more likely to develop autism. This group is easier to study than the general population because fewer test subjects are needed to find children who will go on to develop autism. But it is not clear if these “baby sibs” are somehow categorically different from others on the spectrum.\n\nTo find enough children to make their study useful, the research team followed more than 500 infants, scanning many of them in the middle of the night so they would be in a deep sleep. It took years to get enough valid data on 150 of them, and the families volunteered their time. “Often we don’t keep in mind the degree of work it takes to do this kind of study,” Dawson says.\n\nHazlett and senior author Joseph Piven, a colleague at the CIDD, say they began the research about a decade ago, after an earlier study suggested the brains of autistic children were already unusually large by the time they reached their second birthdays—and before autism’s behavioral symptoms usually emerge.\n\nPiven, a psychiatrist, says the mechanism is not precisely clear. But he speculates babies who go on to become autistic experience the world differently in the first year of life than kids who will not have autism do—and that this altered experience of the world may contribute to subsequent brain development in autism.\n\nDawson says because the brain is changing so much in the first year of life, it may be a critical window of development when behavioral interventions—such as teaching a child to pay attention to a parent’s facial expressions—might have the biggest effect. Because it has not been clear until recently that autistic differences begin as early as pregnancy and infancy, there are no therapies to treat such young children. But such treatments are currently being tested. By giving researchers a potential tool to diagnose babies, Dawson says the new study could open up possibilities for testing the potential new therapies.\n\nMcPartland described possible treatments as “hyper-parenting.” Whereas it might be okay to leave a neurotypical child to play with a toy, a child headed for autism might benefit from more interaction, he says, with a parent cooing, laughing and singing. “Supersaturate a child’s environment with social information much as you can,” he says. “And hope that it takes.”\n\n\n""]]"

The loss, however, showed up in some ocean basins more than others. The largest overall volume of oxygen was lost in the largest ocean — the Pacific — but as a percentage, the decline was sharpest in the Arctic Ocean, a region facing Earth’s most stark climate change.\n\nThe loss of ocean oxygen “has been assumed from models, and there have been lots of regional analysis that have shown local decline, but it has never been shown on the global scale, and never for the deep ocean,” said Schmidtko, who conducted the research with Lothar Stramma and Martin Visbeck, also of GEOMAR.\n\nOcean oxygen is vital to marine organisms, but also very delicate — unlike in the atmosphere, where gases mix together thoroughly, in the ocean that is far harder to accomplish, Schmidtko explained. Moreover, he added, just 1 percent of all the Earth’s available oxygen mixes into the ocean; the vast majority remains in the air.\n\nClimate change models predict the oceans will lose oxygen because of several factors. Most obvious is simply that warmer water holds less dissolved gases, including oxygen [Hyperlink]. “It’s the same reason we keep our sparkling drinks pretty cold,” Schmidtko said.\n\nBut another factor is the growing stratification of ocean waters. Oxygen enters the ocean at its surface, from the atmosphere and from the photosynthetic activity of marine microorganisms. But as that upper layer warms up, the oxygen-rich waters are less likely to mix down into cooler layers of the ocean because the warm waters are less dense and do not sink as readily.\n\n“When the upper ocean warms, less water gets down deep, and so therefore, the oxygen supply to the deep ocean is shut down or significantly reduced,” Schmidtko said.\n\nThe new study represents a synthesis of literally “millions” of separate ocean measurements over time, according to GEOMAR. The authors then used interpolation techniques for areas of the ocean where they lacked measurements.\n\nThe resulting study attributes less than 15 percent of the total oxygen loss to sheer warmer temperatures, which create less solubility.

They do not make a definitive attribution statement, but the data are consistent with and strongly suggestive of human-driven warming as a root cause of the oxygen decline.\n\n“It is alarming to see this signal begin to emerge clearly in the observational data,” he added.\n\n“Schmidtko and colleagues’ findings should ring yet more alarm bells about the consequences of global warming,” added Denis Gilbert, a researcher with the Maurice Lamontagne Institute at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Quebec, in an accompanying commentary on the study also published in Nature.\n\nBecause oxygen in the global ocean is not evenly distributed, the 2 percent overall decline means there is a much larger decline in some areas of the ocean than others.\n\nMoreover, the ocean already contains so-called oxygen minimum zones, generally found in the middle depths. The great fear is that their expansion upward, into habitats where fish and other organism thrive, will reduce the available habitat for marine organisms.\n\nIn shallower waters, meanwhile, the development of ocean “hypoxic” areas, or so-called “dead zones,” may also be influenced in part by declining oxygen content overall.\n\nOn top of all of that, declining ocean oxygen can also worsen global warming in a feedback loop. In or near low oxygen areas of the oceans, microorganisms tend to produce nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas, Gilbert writes.

It’s tempting to use the inauguration as an excuse to finally close the chapter on the 2016 election and instead turn the page to the four years ahead. But for journalists, given the exceptional challenges that Trump poses to the press and the extraordinary moment he represents in American history, it’s also imperative to learn from our experiences in covering Trump to date.\n\nAs editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight, which takes a different and more data-driven perspective than many news organizations, I don’t claim to speak to every question about how to cover Trump. And I don’t expect many of the answers to be obvious or easy. But in the part of the story that I know best, horse-race coverage,1 the results of the learning process have been discouraging so far.\n\nWhile data geeks and traditional journalists each made their share of mistakes when assessing Trump’s chances during the campaign, their behavior since the election has been different. After Trump’s victory, the various academics and journalists who’d built models to estimate the election odds engaged in detailed self-assessments of how their forecasts had performed. Not all of these assessments were mea culpas — ours emphatically wasn’t (more about that in a moment) — but they at least grappled with the reality of what the models had said.2\nBy contrast, some traditional reporters and editors have built a revisionist history about how they covered Trump and why he won. Perhaps the biggest myth is when traditional journalists claim they weren’t making predictions about the outcome. That may still largely be true for local reporters, but at the major national news outlets, campaign correspondents rarely stick to just-the-facts reporting (“Hillary Clinton held a rally in Des Moines today”). Instead, it’s increasingly common for articles about the campaign to contain a mix of analysis and reporting and to make plenty of explicit and implicit predictions. (Usually, these take the form of authoritatively worded analytical claims about the race, such as declaring which states are in play in the Electoral College.) Furthermore, editors and reporters make judgments about the horse race in order to decide which stories to devote resources to and how to frame them for their readers: Go back and read their coverage and it’s clear that The Washington Post was prepared for the possibility of a Trump victory in a way that The New York Times wasn’t, for instance.\n\nIf almost everyone got the first draft of history wrong in 2016, perhaps there’s still time to get the second draft right.\nAnother myth is that Trump’s victory represented some sort of catastrophic failure for the polls. Trump outperformed his national polls by only 1 to 2 percentage points in losing the popular vote to Clinton, making them slightly closer to the mark than they were in 2012. Meanwhile, he beat his polls by only 2 to 3 percentage points in the average swing state.3 Certainly, there were individual pollsters that had some explaining to do, especially in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Trump beat his polls by a larger amount. But the result was not some sort of massive outlier; on the contrary, the polls were pretty much as accurate as they’d been, on average, since 1968.\n\nWhy, then, had so many people who covered the campaign been so confident of Clinton’s chances? This is the question I’ve spent the past two to three months thinking about. It turns out to have some complicated answers, which is why it’s taken some time to put this article together (and this is actually the introduction to a long series of articles on this question that we’ll publish over the next few weeks). But the answers are potentially a lot more instructive for how to cover Trump’s White House and future elections than the ones you’d get by simply blaming the polls for the failure to foresee the outcome. They also suggest there are real shortcomings in how American politics are covered, including pervasive groupthink among media elites, an unhealthy obsession with the insider’s view of politics, a lack of analytical rigor, a failure to appreciate uncertainty, a sluggishness to self-correct when new evidence contradicts pre-existing beliefs, and a narrow viewpoint that lacks perspective from the longer arc of American history. Call me a curmudgeon, but I think we journalists ought to spend a few more moments thinking about these things before we endorse the cutely contrarian idea that Trump’s presidency might somehow be a good thing for the media.\n\nTo be clear, if the polls themselves have gotten too much blame, then misinterpretation and misreporting of the polls is a major part of the story. Throughout the campaign, the polls had hallmarks of high uncertainty, indicating a volatile election with large numbers of undecided voters. And at several key moments they’d also shown a close race. In the week leading up to Election Day, Clinton was only barely ahead in the states she’d need to secure 270 electoral votes. Traditional journalists, as I’ll argue in this series of articles, mostly interpreted the polls as indicating extreme confidence in Clinton’s chances, however.\n\nSo did many of the statistical models of the campaign, of course. While FiveThirtyEight’s final “polls-only” forecast gave Trump a comparatively generous 3-in-10 chance (29 percent) of winning the Electoral College, it was somewhat outside the consensus, with some other forecasts showing Trump with less than a 1 in 100 shot. Those are radically different forecasts: one model put Trump’s chances about 30 times higher than another, even though they were using basically the same data. Instead of serving as an indication of the challenges of poll interpretation, however, “the models” were often lumped together because they all showed Clinton favored, and they probably reinforced traditional reporters’ confidence in Clinton’s prospects.\n\nBut the overconfidence in Clinton’s chances wasn’t just because of the polls. National journalists usually interpreted conflicting and contradictory information as confirming their prior belief that Clinton would win. The most obvious error, given that Clinton won the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes, is that they frequently mistook Clinton’s weakness in the Electoral College for being a strength. They also focused extensively on Clinton’s potential gains with Hispanic voters, but less on indications of a decline in African-American turnout. At moments when the polls showed the race tightening, meanwhile, reporters frequently focused on other factors, such as early voting and Democrats’ supposedly superior turnout operation, as reasons that Clinton was all but assured of victory.\n\nPost-election coverage has also sometimes misled readers about how stories were reported upon while the campaign was underway. The table below contains some important examples of this. Election post-mortems by major news organizations have tended to skirt past how much importance they attached to FBI Director James Comey’s letter to Congress on Oct. 28, for instance, and how much the polls shifted toward Trump in the immediate aftermath of Comey’s letter.\n\nIn other cases, the conventional wisdom has flip-flopped without journalists pausing to consider why they got the story wrong in the first place. For instance, it’s now become fashionable to bash Clinton for having failed to devote enough resources to Michigan and Wisconsin. Never mind, for a moment, that these states wouldn’t have been enough to change the overall result. (If Clinton had won Michigan and Wisconsin, she’d still have only 258 electoral votes.4 To beat Trump, she’d have also needed a state such as Pennsylvania or Florida where she campaigned extensively.) The criticism is ironic given that many stories during the campaign heralded the Clinton campaign’s savviness, while skewering Trump for having campaigned in “solidly blue” states such as Michigan and Wisconsin. It’s fair to question Clinton’s approach, but it’s also important to ask whether journalists put too much stock in the Clinton campaign’s view of the race.\n\nWhat exactly, then, is the “right” story for how Trump won the election? I obviously have a detailed perspective on this — but in a macroscopic view, the following elements seem essential:\n\nFirst, the background conditions were pretty good for Trump. Clinton was trying to win a third consecutive term for her party, replacing a fairly popular predecessor in President Obama, but she was doing that amid a mediocre economy and at a time of high partisanship. Various “fundamentals” models put together by political scientists and economists considered a matchup between a “generic” Republican and a “generic” Democrat (say, between Marco Rubio and Joe Biden) to be roughly a toss-up under these circumstances, or perhaps to slightly favor the GOP. While these models have significant limitations, they argue against the widespread presumption that the election was Clinton’s to lose.\nSecond, demographics gave Trump a big advantage in the Electoral College. Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1 percentage points, similar to George W. Bush’s margin of victory over John Kerry in 2004, after which Bush claimed to have earned a mandate. But she lost in the biggest popular vote-versus-Electoral College discrepancy since 1876. Although Trump has protested otherwise, this discrepancy does not appear to have been mainly the result of tactical choices made by the campaigns. Instead it reflected demographics: White voters without college degrees, by far Trump’s strongest demographic group, were disproportionately concentrated in swing states, while Clinton’s coalition of minorities and college-educated whites (but with declining turnout among black voters) produced huge gains for her in states such as California and Texas without winning her any additional electoral votes.\nThird, voter preferences varied substantially based on news events, and the news cycle ended on a downturn for Clinton. As compared with recent presidential elections, there were a much higher number of undecided and third-party voters in 2016, probably because of the record-setting unpopularity of both Clinton and Trump. As a result, public opinion was sensitive to news coverage and events such as debates, with Clinton holding a national polling lead of as much as 6 to 8 percentage points over Trump in most of June, August and October, but Trump within striking distance in most of July, September and (crucially) November. Late-deciding voters broke strongly toward Trump in the final two weeks of the campaign, amid a news cycle dominated by discussion of the Comey letter and the WikiLeaks hack of Democratic emails.\n\nThis is an uncomfortable story for the mainstream American press. It mostly contradicts the way they covered the election while it was underway (when demographics were often assumed to provide Clinton with an Electoral College advantage, for instance). It puts a fair amount of emphasis on news events such as the Comey letter, which leads to questions about how those stories were covered. It’s much easier to blame the polls for the failure to foresee the outcome, or the Clinton campaign for blowing a sure thing. But we think the evidence lines up with our version of events. And if almost everyone got the first draft of history wrong in 2016, perhaps there’s still time to get the second draft right.\n\n""]]"

It’s tempting to use the inauguration as an excuse to finally close the chapter on the 2016 election and instead turn the page to the four years ahead. But for journalists, given the exceptional challenges that Trump poses to the press and the extraordinary moment he represents in American history, it’s also imperative to learn from our experiences in covering Trump to date.\n\nAs editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight, which takes a different and more data-driven perspective than many news organizations, I don’t claim to speak to every question about how to cover Trump. And I don’t expect many of the answers to be obvious or easy. But in the part of the story that I know best, horse-race coverage,1 the results of the learning process have been discouraging so far.\n\nWhile data geeks and traditional journalists each made their share of mistakes when assessing Trump’s chances during the campaign, their behavior since the election has been different. After Trump’s victory, the various academics and journalists who’d built models to estimate the election odds engaged in detailed self-assessments of how their forecasts had performed. Not all of these assessments were mea culpas — ours emphatically wasn’t (more about that in a moment) — but they at least grappled with the reality of what the models had said.2\nBy contrast, some traditional reporters and editors have built a revisionist history about how they covered Trump and why he won. Perhaps the biggest myth is when traditional journalists claim they weren’t making predictions about the outcome. That may still largely be true for local reporters, but at the major national news outlets, campaign correspondents rarely stick to just-the-facts reporting (“Hillary Clinton held a rally in Des Moines today”). Instead, it’s increasingly common for articles about the campaign to contain a mix of analysis and reporting and to make plenty of explicit and implicit predictions. (Usually, these take the form of authoritatively worded analytical claims about the race, such as declaring which states are in play in the Electoral College.) Furthermore, editors and reporters make judgments about the horse race in order to decide which stories to devote resources to and how to frame them for their readers: Go back and read their coverage and it’s clear that The Washington Post was prepared for the possibility of a Trump victory in a way that The New York Times wasn’t, for instance.\n\nIf almost everyone got the first draft of history wrong in 2016, perhaps there’s still time to get the second draft right.\nAnother myth is that Trump’s victory represented some sort of catastrophic failure for the polls. Trump outperformed his national polls by only 1 to 2 percentage points in losing the popular vote to Clinton, making them slightly closer to the mark than they were in 2012. Meanwhile, he beat his polls by only 2 to 3 percentage points in the average swing state.3 Certainly, there were individual pollsters that had some explaining to do, especially in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Trump beat his polls by a larger amount. But the result was not some sort of massive outlier; on the contrary, the polls were pretty much as accurate as they’d been, on average, since 1968.\n\nWhy, then, had so many people who covered the campaign been so confident of Clinton’s chances? This is the question I’ve spent the past two to three months thinking about. It turns out to have some complicated answers, which is why it’s taken some time to put this article together (and this is actually the introduction to a long series of articles on this question that we’ll publish over the next few weeks). But the answers are potentially a lot more instructive for how to cover Trump’s White House and future elections than the ones you’d get by simply blaming the polls for the failure to foresee the outcome. They also suggest there are real shortcomings in how American politics are covered, including pervasive groupthink among media elites, an unhealthy obsession with the insider’s view of politics, a lack of analytical rigor, a failure to appreciate uncertainty, a sluggishness to self-correct when new evidence contradicts pre-existing beliefs, and a narrow viewpoint that lacks perspective from the longer arc of American history. Call me a curmudgeon, but I think we journalists ought to spend a few more moments thinking about these things before we endorse the cutely contrarian idea that Trump’s presidency might somehow be a good thing for the media.\n\nTo be clear, if the polls themselves have gotten too much blame, then misinterpretation and misreporting of the polls is a major part of the story. Throughout the campaign, the polls had hallmarks of high uncertainty, indicating a volatile election with large numbers of undecided voters. And at several key moments they’d also shown a close race. In the week leading up to Election Day, Clinton was only barely ahead in the states she’d need to secure 270 electoral votes. Traditional journalists, as I’ll argue in this series of articles, mostly interpreted the polls as indicating extreme confidence in Clinton’s chances, however.\n\nSo did many of the statistical models of the campaign, of course. While FiveThirtyEight’s final “polls-only” forecast gave Trump a comparatively generous 3-in-10 chance (29 percent) of winning the Electoral College, it was somewhat outside the consensus, with some other forecasts showing Trump with less than a 1 in 100 shot. Those are radically different forecasts: one model put Trump’s chances about 30 times higher than another, even though they were using basically the same data. Instead of serving as an indication of the challenges of poll interpretation, however, “the models” were often lumped together because they all showed Clinton favored, and they probably reinforced traditional reporters’ confidence in Clinton’s prospects.\n\nBut the overconfidence in Clinton’s chances wasn’t just because of the polls. National journalists usually interpreted conflicting and contradictory information as confirming their prior belief that Clinton would win. The most obvious error, given that Clinton won the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes, is that they frequently mistook Clinton’s weakness in the Electoral College for being a strength.

In June of the previous year, Helena had implemented a comprehensive smoking ban in its workplaces, bars, restaurants, and casinos. In the first six months of the ban, the rate of heart attacks in the city plummeted by nearly 60 percent. Just as remarkably, when a judge struck down the smoking ban in November of that year, the rate of heart attacks shot right back up to its previous level.\n\nFor three anti-smoking advocates—local physicians Richard Sargent and Robert Shepard, and activist and researcher Stanton Glantz from the University of California at San Francisco—this sudden drop in heart attacks was proof that smoking bans usher in extraordinary benefits for public health. “This striking finding suggests that protecting people from the toxins in secondhand smoke not only makes life more pleasant; it immediately starts saving lives,” said Glantz in a press release sent out by UCSF.\n\nNewspapers ran with the story, credulously assuming that the correlation had been truly caused by the smoking ban. “The bottom line of Helena’s plummeting, then soaring, heart attack rate is painfully obvious,” warned an op-ed in the New York Times. “Secondhand smoke kills.” The BBC projected that “[banning] smoking in public places could prevent hundreds of deaths from heart disease.” Wire services carried the result around the globe, and even the conservative Wall Street Journal cited the result as an important finding.\n\nIn the early 2000s, as jurisdictions across the country fought over expanding smoking bans to bars and restaurants, anti-smoking advocates seized on the Helena study and related research showing that secondhand smoke exposure can affect coronary functions to promote fear of secondhand smoke. Groups across the country stated that “even half an hour of secondhand smoke exposure causes heart damage similar to that of habitual smokers.” Not to be outdone, the Association for Nonsmokers in Minnesota wrote in a press release that just 30 seconds of exposure could “make coronary artery function of non-smokers indistinguishable from smokers.” The message to nonsmokers was clear: The briefest exposure to secondhand smoke can kill you.\n\nA decade later, comprehensive smoking bans have proliferated globally. And now that the evidence has had time to accumulate, it’s also become clear that the extravagant promises made by anti-smoking groups—that implementing bans would bring about extraordinary improvements in cardiac health—never materialized. Newer, better studies with much larger sample sizes have found little to no correlation between smoking bans and short-term incidence of heart attacks, and certainly nothing remotely close to the 60 percent reduction that was claimed in Helena. The updated science debunks the alarmist fantasies that were used to sell smoking bans to the public, allowing for a more sober analysis suggesting that current restrictions on smoking are extreme from a risk-reduction standpoint.\n\nBy the time the Helena study was published in the British Medical Journal, the authors had lowered the observed reduction in heart attacks from 60 percent to 40 percent; still an impressive figure but a substantial drop from the claim they had prematurely publicized to press worldwide. Immediate responses to the paper from other scientists were harshly critical, noting the small size of the Helena population—about 68,000 residents at the time—and the medical implausibility of achieving such a massive effect in such a short period. It was impossible to know with certainty whether the drop was caused by the ban or was simply due to chance.\n\n\nNonetheless, the Helena paper spawned a wave of studies seeking to replicate the finding. Research observing similar reductions followed in places such as Pueblo, Colorado; Bowling Green, Ohio; and Monroe County, Indiana. One characteristic shared by these places was their low populations and correspondingly small sample sizes: The last of these studies covered only 22 heart attacks among nonsmokers over the course of nearly four years.\n\nUpdated science debunks the alarmist fantasies that were used to sell smoking bans to the public, allowing for a more sober analysis.\n\nWhen studies sampling larger populations finally appeared, the reported declines in heart attacks began to shrink. A study of the Piedmont region of Italy found a much lower decline of 11 percent, though curiously only for residents under 60 years of age. England, which implemented a smoking ban nationwide, presented the first opportunity to study the matter on a national scale. Researchers there credited the ban with a heart attack reduction of just over 2 percent nationwide.\n\nCritics noted that the rate of heart attacks in England had also been falling in the years prior to the ban and that the reason for the decline was still not clear. Regardless, the data there made it obvious that the miraculous reductions claimed in smaller studies were unrealistically high. Even so, despite acknowledging the wide variation in findings and the admitted methodological limitations of the studies, a 2009 meta-analysis conducted by the Institute of Medicine concluded that the impact of smoking bans on short-term heart attack rates was real and substantial: “Even a small amount of exposure to secondhand smoke… can cause a heart attack,” one member of the IOM panel informed the New York Times, urging that “smoking bans need to be put in place as quickly as possible.”\n\nThis report had, however, omitted one of the largest studies of secondhand smoke and heart attacks conducted to date. A 2008 study covering the entire country of New Zealand—a population smaller than England’s, but bigger than the American towns previously studied—found no significant effects on heart attacks or unstable angina in the year following implementation of a smoking ban; hospitalizations for the former had actually increased.\n\nAdvertisement \nContradictory research continued to come in. A clever study led by researchers at RAND Corp. in 2010 tested the possibility that the large reductions identified in small communities were due to chance. They assembled a massive data set that allowed them to essentially replicate studies like those in Helena, Pueblo, and Bowling Green, but on an unprecedented scale. Whereas those studies had compared just one small community to another, the RAND paper compared all possible pairings of communities affected by smoking bans to all possible controls, for a total of more than 15,000 pairings. They stratified results by age in case there were differential effects on the young, working age adults, or the elderly. And in an improvement on most other studies, they also controlled for existing trends in the rate of heart attacks.\n\nThe study found no statistically significant decrease in heart attacks among any age group. The data also suggested that fluctuations in heart attack rates were common, indicating that comparisons of small communities would frequently turn up dramatic reductions due purely to chance; large increases in heart attacks happened about as often. This explained the headline-grabbing dramatic results in places like Helena or Monroe County that eluded replication in larger jurisdictions. The conclusion of the study was blunt: “We find no evidence that legislated U.S. smoking bans were associated with short-term reductions in hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction or other diseases in the elderly, children or working age adults.”\n\nA 2012 study of six American states that had instituted smoking bans came to a similar conclusion. So did a 2014 study, which is notable for being co-authored by some of the same researchers who had previously published papers suggesting that the Colorado towns of Pueblo and Greeley had experienced reduced rates of heart attacks after implementing smoking bans. When Colorado enacted a statewide ban, the authors had an opportunity to see if their earlier results could be duplicated across the larger population of nearly 5 million people. No effect appeared. As an additional test, they re-examined the data excluding 11 jurisdictions that had already implemented comprehensive smoking bans: The statewide ban still showed no effect.\n\nIn the paper’s admirably honest commentary, the authors reflected on the reasons that earlier studies, including their own, had overstated the impact of smoking bans. The first is that small sample sizes allowed random variances in data to be mistaken for real effects. The second is that most previous studies failed to account for existing downward trends in the rate of heart attacks. And the third is publication bias: Since no one believes that smoking bans increase heart attacks, few would bother submitting or publishing studies that show a positive correlation or null effect. Thus the published record is likely unintentionally biased toward showing a larger effect than truly exists.\n\nWhere heart attacks did decline, it may not have even been because of secondhand smoke reductions.\n\nAdvertisement \nThe medical reasoning behind why secondhand smoke would cause heart attacks posited that short-term exposure reduces blood flow, increases platelet aggregation, and causes endothelial dysfunction—all of which could increase the risk of heart attack. But looking at the most well-conducted research suggests that the actual impact is not as significant as originally feared. And where heart attacks did decline, it may not have even been because of secondhand smoke reductions: A new paper published in August 2016 considered other factors that may have been overlooked. Drawing on data from 28 states from 2001–2008, lead author Vivian Ho, an economist at Rice University, compared rates of hospitalization for heart attacks in areas with and without smoking bans.\n\nFollowing the methodology of previous studies, she and her coauthors found a statistically significant reduction in hospitalizations for heart attacks and congestive heart failure following implementation of a smoking ban (though only among people older than 65). But when they went a step further, adjusting the analysis with county-by-county health data addressing variables such as access to hospitals and increases in cigarette taxes, the effect of the smoking bans disappeared. Ho and her co-authors suggest that modest improvements in cardiac health that were previously credited to smoking bans may actually be caused by differentials in access to medical care and people smoking less when cigarette taxes increase (smoking cigarettes does have a proven negative effect on cardiac health).\n\nIn the recent literature, the most notable study finding a correlation between smoking bans and rates of heart attack is a 2012 paper in Health Affairs. It is probably the strongest of the studies documenting a reduction, though it applies only to senior populations and did not make the adjustment for tobacco taxes noted above. Even those sympathetic to the claim that bans reduce heart attacks have had to concede that the larger the population studied, the smaller the alleged effect. A 2013 meta-analysis noted that “studies with smaller population in the United States usually reported larger reductions … while larger studies reported relatively modest reductions.” Or, to state things more accurately, the largest studies often report no reduction at all.\n\nIn a post on the blog he authors from the University of California San Francisco, Stanton Glantz disputes the finding in Vivian Ho’s recent paper, suggesting use of a different statistical model to make the calculation. But the reductions promised by Glantz and other smoking ban advocates were so massive that they ought to be evident under any plausible model. That in the time since the alleged Helena Miracle they have gone from claiming a 60 percent reduction in heart attacks to debating whether effects are illusory or just too small to be reliably detected says a lot about how far expectations have been lowered. As they say in the old cigarette ads, “You’ve come a long way, baby!”\n\nAnti-smoking advocates often argue as if the existence of any effect on health, no matter how small, justifies any smoking ban no matter how extensive. If the size and certainty of alleged health risks are irrelevant, then of course the case for smoking bans is easy to make: Most nonsmokers find smoking inconvenient and have little regard for the smoking minority’s preferences. Setting such a low bar provides a convenient excuse for expanding the boundaries of the smoke-free world ever outward. The relevant question, however, should not be merely whether there are any dangers from secondhand smoke but also how big they are. If the alarmist claims made by anti-smoking groups were true, we’d be justified in avoiding secondhand smoke as if it were the plague. But we know now that those claims were exaggerated, so it’s worth asking whether contemporary bans have gone too far.\n\nRates of heart attack are not the only possible negative of secondhand smoke exposure, although most estimates consider improvements in coronary health to be the number one benefit of smoking bans. There are also potential impacts on respiratory health, and of course lung cancer, although the impact secondhand smoke exposure has on one’s risk of lung cancer is likely far lower than many would expect. The 2006 Surgeon General’s Report, the most definitive treatment of the topic, estimates the lung cancer risk of chronically exposed nonsmokers at just 1.12–1.43 times that of people without frequent exposure. (By comparison, smokers themselves take on a risk more than 12 times higher than that of nonsmokers.)\n\nWe know now that those claims were exaggerated, so it’s worth asking if contemporary bans have gone too far.\n\nNow that’s not nothing, but other recent research may be even more surprising. “No clear link between passive smoking and lung cancer,” read a 2013 headline in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, hardly a pro-tobacco publication. That was a report on a cohort study tracking 76,000 women that failed to detect a link between the disease and secondhand smoke. The finding comports with existing literature suggesting that the effect is borderline and concentrated on long-term, high levels of exposure.\n\nThe cost of these policies falls almost entirely on people who smoke, an increasingly put-upon minority of the population. Rarely are their preferences consulted. An exception is a perceptive paper published in the journal Sociology of Health and Illness evocatively titled “Every Space is Claimed.” The paper stands out for the empathy with which its authors approach smokers affected by smoking bans. They note that most tobacco research ignores the perspective of actual smokers and that the lack of interest in their experiences “speaks to the ways in which tobacco research is increasingly expected to further the goals of tobacco control.”\n\nThe paper draws on interviews with a diverse selection of smokers in Vancouver, British Columbia. One consistent theme that emerges is that smokers increasingly find their habit viewed as on a par with use of illicit drugs. Smokers also report that judgments against them cut deeper than their outward behavior, extending to their identity as human beings. “Even if you can’t articulate it you probably intuitively feel it in the same way that if you’re black or a woman and you’re being discriminated against,” one subject told his interviewers. “Like even if you can’t articulate it or you certainly can’t prove it or you’d be at the Human Rights Commission, but you kind of know it’s happening.”\n\nTo some anti-smoking advocates, that stigmatization is useful if it encourages people to quit. The authors of this paper are skeptical, noting that such stigmatization could instead lead to feelings of powerlessness. They conclude:\n\n“Participants in our study highlighted the growing restrictions on their ability to smoke and several explicitly recognised that legislative measures went well beyond the goal of protecting non-smokers from exposure to the effects of secondhand smoke and that the right to smoke altogether was being steadily eroded. Thus, while many participants expressed the view that smoking restrictions themselves were not intrinsically problematic, they emphasised that tobacco denormalisation had created an environment in which every public space was ‘claimed’ by non-smokers, making it impossible to smoke in public at all without receiving judgement. Importantly, while study participants expressed considerable felt stigma in relation to their smoking, they also recounted numerous instances of overt censure and discrimination.\nSmokers’ experiences in Vancouver raise important questions about the value and ethics of denormalisation strategies. Should a liberal state ever be complicit in shaming its citizens?”\n\nEarly arguments for smoking bans at least paid lip service to the idea that restrictions were necessary to protect unwilling bystanders’ health.

In June of the previous year, Helena had implemented a comprehensive smoking ban in its workplaces, bars, restaurants, and casinos. In the first six months of the ban, the rate of heart attacks in the city plummeted by nearly 60 percent. Just as remarkably, when a judge struck down the smoking ban in November of that year, the rate of heart attacks shot right back up to its previous level.\n\nFor three anti-smoking advocates—local physicians Richard Sargent and Robert Shepard, and activist and researcher Stanton Glantz from the University of California at San Francisco—this sudden drop in heart attacks was proof that smoking bans usher in extraordinary benefits for public health. “This striking finding suggests that protecting people from the toxins in secondhand smoke not only makes life more pleasant; it immediately starts saving lives,” said Glantz in a press release sent out by UCSF.\n\nNewspapers ran with the story, credulously assuming that the correlation had been truly caused by the smoking ban. “The bottom line of Helena’s plummeting, then soaring, heart attack rate is painfully obvious,” warned an op-ed in the New York Times. “Secondhand smoke kills.” The BBC projected that “[banning] smoking in public places could prevent hundreds of deaths from heart disease.” Wire services carried the result around the globe, and even the conservative Wall Street Journal cited the result as an important finding.\n\nIn the early 2000s, as jurisdictions across the country fought over expanding smoking bans to bars and restaurants, anti-smoking advocates seized on the Helena study and related research showing that secondhand smoke exposure can affect coronary functions to promote fear of secondhand smoke. Groups across the country stated that “even half an hour of secondhand smoke exposure causes heart damage similar to that of habitual smokers.” Not to be outdone, the Association for Nonsmokers in Minnesota wrote in a press release that just 30 seconds of exposure could “make coronary artery function of non-smokers indistinguishable from smokers.” The message to nonsmokers was clear: The briefest exposure to secondhand smoke can kill you.\n\nA decade later, comprehensive smoking bans have proliferated globally. And now that the evidence has had time to accumulate, it’s also become clear that the extravagant promises made by anti-smoking groups—that implementing bans would bring about extraordinary improvements in cardiac health—never materialized. Newer, better studies with much larger sample sizes have found little to no correlation between smoking bans and short-term incidence of heart attacks, and certainly nothing remotely close to the 60 percent reduction that was claimed in Helena. The updated science debunks the alarmist fantasies that were used to sell smoking bans to the public, allowing for a more sober analysis suggesting that current restrictions on smoking are extreme from a risk-reduction standpoint.\n\nBy the time the Helena study was published in the British Medical Journal, the authors had lowered the observed reduction in heart attacks from 60 percent to 40 percent; still an impressive figure but a substantial drop from the claim they had prematurely publicized to press worldwide. Immediate responses to the paper from other scientists were harshly critical, noting the small size of the Helena population—about 68,000 residents at the time—and the medical implausibility of achieving such a massive effect in such a short period. It was impossible to know with certainty whether the drop was caused by the ban or was simply due to chance.\n\n\nNonetheless, the Helena paper spawned a wave of studies seeking to replicate the finding. Research observing similar reductions followed in places such as Pueblo, Colorado; Bowling Green, Ohio; and Monroe County, Indiana. One characteristic shared by these places was their low populations and correspondingly small sample sizes: The last of these studies covered only 22 heart attacks among nonsmokers over the course of nearly four years.\n\nUpdated science debunks the alarmist fantasies that were used to sell smoking bans to the public, allowing for a more sober analysis.\n\nWhen studies sampling larger populations finally appeared, the reported declines in heart attacks began to shrink. A study of the Piedmont region of Italy found a much lower decline of 11 percent, though curiously only for residents under 60 years of age. England, which implemented a smoking ban nationwide, presented the first opportunity to study the matter on a national scale. Researchers there credited the ban with a heart attack reduction of just over 2 percent nationwide.\n\nCritics noted that the rate of heart attacks in England had also been falling in the years prior to the ban and that the reason for the decline was still not clear. Regardless, the data there made it obvious that the miraculous reductions claimed in smaller studies were unrealistically high. Even so, despite acknowledging the wide variation in findings and the admitted methodological limitations of the studies, a 2009 meta-analysis conducted by the Institute of Medicine concluded that the impact of smoking bans on short-term heart attack rates was real and substantial: “Even a small amount of exposure to secondhand smoke… can cause a heart attack,” one member of the IOM panel informed the New York Times, urging that “smoking bans need to be put in place as quickly as possible.”\n\nThis report had, however, omitted one of the largest studies of secondhand smoke and heart attacks conducted to date. A 2008 study covering the entire country of New Zealand—a population smaller than England’s, but bigger than the American towns previously studied—found no significant effects on heart attacks or unstable angina in the year following implementation of a smoking ban; hospitalizations for the former had actually increased.\n\nAdvertisement \nContradictory research continued to come in. A clever study led by researchers at RAND Corp. in 2010 tested the possibility that the large reductions identified in small communities were due to chance. They assembled a massive data set that allowed them to essentially replicate studies like those in Helena, Pueblo, and Bowling Green, but on an unprecedented scale. Whereas those studies had compared just one small community to another, the RAND paper compared all possible pairings of communities affected by smoking bans to all possible controls, for a total of more than 15,000 pairings. They stratified results by age in case there were differential effects on the young, working age adults, or the elderly. And in an improvement on most other studies, they also controlled for existing trends in the rate of heart attacks.\n\nThe study found no statistically significant decrease in heart attacks among any age group. The data also suggested that fluctuations in heart attack rates were common, indicating that comparisons of small communities would frequently turn up dramatic reductions due purely to chance; large increases in heart attacks happened about as often. This explained the headline-grabbing dramatic results in places like Helena or Monroe County that eluded replication in larger jurisdictions. The conclusion of the study was blunt: “We find no evidence that legislated U.S. smoking bans were associated with short-term reductions in hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction or other diseases in the elderly, children or working age adults.”\n\nA 2012 study of six American states that had instituted smoking bans came to a similar conclusion. So did a 2014 study, which is notable for being co-authored by some of the same researchers who had previously published papers suggesting that the Colorado towns of Pueblo and Greeley had experienced reduced rates of heart attacks after implementing smoking bans. When Colorado enacted a statewide ban, the authors had an opportunity to see if their earlier results could be duplicated across the larger population of nearly 5 million people. No effect appeared. As an additional test, they re-examined the data excluding 11 jurisdictions that had already implemented comprehensive smoking bans: The statewide ban still showed no effect.\n\nIn the paper’s admirably honest commentary, the authors reflected on the reasons that earlier studies, including their own, had overstated the impact of smoking bans. The first is that small sample sizes allowed random variances in data to be mistaken for real effects. The second is that most previous studies failed to account for existing downward trends in the rate of heart attacks. And the third is publication bias: Since no one believes that smoking bans increase heart attacks, few would bother submitting or publishing studies that show a positive correlation or null effect. Thus the published record is likely unintentionally biased toward showing a larger effect than truly exists.\n\nWhere heart attacks did decline, it may not have even been because of secondhand smoke reductions.\n\nAdvertisement \nThe medical reasoning behind why secondhand smoke would cause heart attacks posited that short-term exposure reduces blood flow, increases platelet aggregation, and causes endothelial dysfunction—all of which could increase the risk of heart attack.

Such premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) affects 2 to 5 percent of women of reproductive age, whereas less severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is much more common.\n\n“We found dysregulated expression in a suspect gene complex which adds to evidence that PMDD is a disorder of cellular response to estrogen and progesterone,” explained Peter Schmidt, M.D. of the NIH’s National Institute of Mental Health, Behavioral Endocrinology Branch. “Learning more about the role of this gene complex holds hope for improved treatment of such prevalent reproductive endocrine-related mood disorders.”\n\nSchmidt, David Goldman, M.D., of the NIH’s National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and colleagues, report on their findings January 3, 2017 in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.\n\n“This is a big moment for women’s health, because it establishes that women with PMDD have an intrinsic difference in their molecular apparatus for response to sex hormones – not just emotional behaviors they should be able to voluntarily control,” said Goldman.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the NIMH team had demonstrated (link is external) that women who regularly experience mood disorder symptoms just prior to their periods were abnormally sensitive to normal changes in sex hormones — even though their hormone levels were normal. But the cause remained a mystery.\n\nIn women with PMDD, experimentally turning off estrogen and progesterone eliminated PMDD symptoms, while experimentally adding back the hormones triggered the re-emergence of symptoms. This confirmed that they had a biologically-based behavioral sensitivity to the hormones that might be reflected in molecular differences detectable in their cells.\n\nFollowing up on clues – including the fact that PMS is 56 percent heritable — the NIH researchers studied the genetic control of gene expression in cultured white blood cell lines from women with PMDD and controls. These cells express many of the same genes expressed in brain cells — potentially providing a window into genetically-influenced differences in molecular responses to sex hormones.\n\nAn analysis of all gene transcription in the cultured cell lines turned up a large gene complex in which gene expression differed conspicuously in cells from patients compared to controls. Notably, this ESC/E(Z) (Extra Sex Combs/Enhancer of Zeste) gene complex regulates epigenetic mechanisms that govern the transcription of genes into proteins in response to the environment — including sex hormones and stressors.\n\nMore than half of the ESC/E(Z) genes were over-expressed in PMDD patients’ cells, compared to cells from controls. But paradoxically, protein expression of four key genes was decreased in cells from women with PMDD. In addition, progesterone boosted expression of several of these genes in controls, while estrogen decreased expression in cell lines derived from PMDD patients. This suggested dysregulated cellular response to the hormones in PMDD.\n\n“For the first time, we now have cellular evidence of abnormal signaling in cells derived from women with PMDD, and a plausible biological cause for their abnormal behavioral sensitivity to estrogen and progesterone,” explained Schmidt.\n\nUsing cutting edge \""disease in a dish\"" technologies, the researchers are now following up the leads discovered in blood cell lines in neurons induced from stem cells derived from the blood of PMDD patients – in hopes of gaining a more direct window into the ESC/E(Z) complex’s role in the brain.\n""]]"

Such premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) affects 2 to 5 percent of women of reproductive age, whereas less severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is much more common.\n\n“We found dysregulated expression in a suspect gene complex which adds to evidence that PMDD is a disorder of cellular response to estrogen and progesterone,” explained Peter Schmidt, M.D. of the NIH’s National Institute of Mental Health, Behavioral Endocrinology Branch. “Learning more about the role of this gene complex holds hope for improved treatment of such prevalent reproductive endocrine-related mood disorders.”\n\nSchmidt, David Goldman, M.D., of the NIH’s National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and colleagues, report on their findings January 3, 2017 in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.\n\n“This is a big moment for women’s health, because it establishes that women with PMDD have an intrinsic difference in their molecular apparatus for response to sex hormones – not just emotional behaviors they should be able to voluntarily control,” said Goldman.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the NIMH team had demonstrated (link is external) that women who regularly experience mood disorder symptoms just prior to their periods were abnormally sensitive to normal changes in sex hormones — even though their hormone levels were normal. But the cause remained a mystery.\n\nIn women with PMDD, experimentally turning off estrogen and progesterone eliminated PMDD symptoms, while experimentally adding back the hormones triggered the re-emergence of symptoms. This confirmed that they had a biologically-based behavioral sensitivity to the hormones that might be reflected in molecular differences detectable in their cells.\n\nFollowing up on clues – including the fact that PMS is 56 percent heritable — the NIH researchers studied the genetic control of gene expression in cultured white blood cell lines from women with PMDD and controls. These cells express many of the same genes expressed in brain cells — potentially providing a window into genetically-influenced differences in molecular responses to sex hormones.\n\nAn analysis of all gene transcription in the cultured cell lines turned up a large gene complex in which gene expression differed conspicuously in cells from patients compared to controls. Notably, this ESC/E(Z) (Extra Sex Combs/Enhancer of Zeste) gene complex regulates epigenetic mechanisms that govern the transcription of genes into proteins in response to the environment — including sex hormones and stressors.\n\nMore than half of the ESC/E(Z) genes were over-expressed in PMDD patients’ cells, compared to cells from controls. But paradoxically, protein expression of four key genes was decreased in cells from women with PMDD. In addition, progesterone boosted expression of several of these genes in controls, while estrogen decreased expression in cell lines derived from PMDD patients. This suggested dysregulated cellular response to the hormones in PMDD.\n\n“For the first time, we now have cellular evidence of abnormal signaling in cells derived from women with PMDD, and a plausible biological cause for their abnormal behavioral sensitivity to estrogen and progesterone,” explained Schmidt.\n\nUsing cutting edge \""disease in a dish\"" technologies, the researchers are now following up the leads discovered in blood cell lines in neurons induced from stem cells derived from the blood of PMDD patients – in hopes of gaining a more direct window into the ESC/E(Z) complex’s role in the brain.\n""]]"

It also tends to favor lean sources of protein like chicken or fish over red meat, which contains more saturated fat.\n\n“Our hypothesis is that these dietary antioxidants may bind to HDL particles and protect them against different kinds of attacks,” Hernáez said by email. “As HDLs are more protected, they can perform their biological functions more efficiently and, therefore, they are able to remove cholesterol from arteries or contribute to the relaxation of blood vessels for longer.”\n\nHigh levels of low density lipoproteins (LDL) or “bad” cholesterol and fats known as triglycerides are associated with an increased risk of heart and blood vessel diseases. HDL, or “good,” cholesterol is associated with a lower risk because it helps remove excess LDL from the bloodstream.\n\nFor the current study, Hernáez and colleagues examined data on 296 older adults at risk for cardiovascular disease who were randomly assigned to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with one liter per week (about 34 fluid ounces) of extra virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with 30 grams (1 oz) of nuts a day, or a low-fat diet.\n\nParticipants were 66 years old on average, and they were asked to follow their assigned diet for one year.\n\nOnly the low-fat diet was associated with reduced LDL and total cholesterol levels, researchers report in a paper scheduled for publication in the journal Circulation.\n\nNone of the diets increased HDL levels significantly.\n\nBut blood tests and lab work showed better HDL functioning in the group assigned to the Mediterranean diet with extra olive oil.\n\nWhile some previous research has linked a Mediterranean diet to weight loss and a reduced risk of heart disease and some cancers, scientists haven’t conclusively proven that the diet itself is responsible, instead of other lifestyle choices made by people who eat this way.\n\nLimitations of the current study include the fact that all three diets were relatively healthy, making it difficult to detect meaningful differences in outcomes, the authors note.\n\nStill, the findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that HDL function may influence cardiovascular disease risk, Dr. Daniel Rader of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia writes in an accompanying editorial.\n\n“We know the Mediterranean diet reduces risk of heart disease but still don’t know exactly why,” Rader said by email. “There is probably more than one reason, and this study suggests that one mechanism might be that the Mediterranean diet improves the function of HDL.”\n\nEven without clear evidence explaining why the Mediterranean diet may help the heart, eating this way can still make sense, Rader added.\n\n“For people who are interested in reducing their risk of heart disease, the Mediterranean diet is probably the best proven diet to reduce risk,” Rader said. “I think the majority of people who don’t have other major dietary concerns should look toward the Mediterranean diet as a heart healthy diet.”\n\n""]]"

This is the sharpest two-year rise since 1964, says the council, a nonprofit focused on eliminating preventable deaths.\n\nThe worst month in 2016 was October, which contributed 3,790 to the total 40,200 highway deaths, according to the report. January saw the lowest number, with 2,740 deaths.\n\nAs might be expected due to the overall population of certain individual states, Texas, California and Florida each had more than 3,000 deaths in 2016.\nAlaska, Vermont, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia had the least, with fewer than 100 deaths each.\n\nOverall, the researchers estimated 12.4 deaths per 100,000 people in 2016, a 5% increase over the 2015 rate. They also estimate about 4.6 million motor-vehicle injuries required a medical consultation in 2016, an increase of 7% from 2015.\nFigures from 2014 and 2015 were gathered from the National Center for Health Statistics, but estimates for 2016 are still considered a preliminary tally, compiled by the safety council from each state's traffic authorities.\n\nMore drivers on the road\n\n\""During the recession, the number of deaths on our roadways went down a lot. We were driving less,\"" said Ken Kolosh, manager of statistics at the National Safety Council. Traffic deaths dropped during the years 2008 through 2010, with a very slow increase then taking place until 2015.\n\nThese days, gas prices are lower and job growth is better, so people are traveling more often. For 2016, the council estimated a 3% increase in motor-vehicle mileage over the previous year, however, this increase in traffic, unfortunately, also leads to a swelling number of highway fatalities.\n\nHowever, a 3% increase in miles driven versus a 6% increase in deaths suggests something else is at play.\n\nKolosh saw evidence that \""teenagers and young drivers were impacted and lost access to vehicles during the recession.\"" With the economy improving, teens are back on the highways, he said.\n\n\""We see actually a decrease in drivers talking on their phones -- either handheld or hands-free -- but increasingly, we're seeing drivers texting or doing other activities on their phones,\"" Kolosh said. Not surprisingly, he points to \""our younger drivers, the 15- to 24-year-olds\"" as most responsible for this shift.\n\n\""At any given daylight moment, nearly 5% of them are likely texting or doing something else on their phones while behind the wheel,\"" he said. \""We're also seeing a very, very large increase in the number of vulnerable road users who are dying on our roads.\""\n\nVulnerable road users include pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists.\nThough it's known that distracted driving is on the rise, \""the role of the distracted pedestrian\"" may be an understudied problem, according to Kolosh, who cites a 9% increase in the number of pedestrian deaths on the road between 2015 and 2016.\n\""We are pretty sure there's more distracted pedestrians in our towns, on our sidewalks, than ever before, and that's probably increasing,\"" he said. Although aware that it's not safe to text while driving, pedestrians think nothing of doing so while walking, said Kolosh.\n\n'Booze, belts and speed'\n\nAccording to Kara Macek, senior director of communications and programs at the Governors Highway Safety Association, road death numbers \""often fluctuate a bit year-to-year.\"" However, \""this is definitely a troubling new trend, and it's difficult to pinpoint one precise cause.\""\n\nThe association is a nonprofit representing state and territorial highway safety offices. Macek was not involved in the new safety report.\n\nMacek also points to the growing economy, which has resulted in more people driving more often. She further attributes the increasing deaths to a rise in \""our growing appetite for connectivity, which leads drivers to dangerous distractions,\"" but believes the core reasons have not changed that much.\n\n\""What's killing people on the road? It's still booze, belts and speed,\"" said Macek, who noted that in 2015, alcohol and speed were factors in 28% and 27% of fatalities, while 48% of those killed in car crashes were not buckled up.\n\nJessica Cicchino, vice president of research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent scientific and educational organization, also believes economic recovery is the main factor behind the recent increase in deaths.\n\n\""It's not just that Americans drive more miles when the economy improves. It's the kind of miles they drive,\"" said Cicchino, who did not contribute to the new report. \""What comes back after a recession is the optional driving that's riskier, like going out on the weekends or taking long trips on unfamiliar roads.\""\n\nBecause she didn't see \""a spike in cell phone use cited as a factor in fatal crashes,\"" Cicchino is less likely to blame distracted driving. However, she said, \""teens, the age group with the highest fatal crash rates per mile driven, are back on the road after the recession.\""\n\nIn addition, many states may be implementing policies that counter highway safety, according to Cicchino.\n\n\""In the last three years alone, 13 states have raised speed limits on at least some portion of their interstates,\"" she said: Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nOf these states, five states -- Maryland, Montana, South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming -- showed a diminished number of highway deaths, however the majority showed increases, suggesting her theory is mainly correct.\n\nOf all the states, Wyoming had the most improved rate, with a 25% decrease in roadway fatalities over the past two years, from 149 deaths in 2014 to 112 in 2016.\n\nWyoming, the model state\n\nLt. David Wagener of the Wyoming Highway Patrol finds it difficult to pinpoint the reason why his state is leading the nation in decreased highway fatalities.\n\""There was some slowdown in coal and other natural resource industries in Wyoming in 2016, so there were less people on the highways because of that, and there was less traffic moving, so that's one reason,\"" he said.\n\""But really,\"" he said, \""it comes down to the individual making good decisions before they get behind the wheel and good decisions when they are driving.\""\nThose good decisions include \""making sure they get enough sleep, making sure they're not driving impaired, making sure they're wearing seat belts, making sure children in the vehicle are buckled in or wearing child restraints.\""\nHis unofficial numbers match up with the estimates from the Safety Council.\n\""According to the spreadsheet I have, 55 of those 112 fatalities had a seat belt available in the vehicle they were in, yet they chose not to wear it at the time of the crash,\"" Wagener said.\n\""We have 34 listed as alcohol-related,\"" he added. Wyoming also counted 24 deaths among motorcyclists -- 39 rollover-related, nine weather-related -- and three deaths among ATV drivers.\n\nHighway Patrol Sgt. Dwayne Ellis credits the \""Alive at 25\"" program for significantly reducing the number of crashes and deaths in his state.\n\""We've taught well over 6,000 kids since the (program's) inception in late 2008, and of those, we've been able to identify only six who have died in a crash either as a driver or passenger before their 25th birthday,\"" said Ellis, who is the state's safety education coordinator.\nThough he was not able to provide numbers from 2007 to show the difference, he knows the program is extremely successful in part through feedback from both parents and young adults.\n\""What it does is, it talks about choice-making and consequences and how the choices that they make while driving not only affect them but affect everyone around them and everybody they know,\"" Ellis said. \""We empower them to think about the consequences and make good choices and let them know they are in control of their life -- it's whether they want to take control.\""\nThe class, part of a national program, is given in schools as part of the drivers education curriculum or can be taken on a volunteer basis or as an insurance deduction.

This is the sharpest two-year rise since 1964, says the council, a nonprofit focused on eliminating preventable deaths.\n\nThe worst month in 2016 was October, which contributed 3,790 to the total 40,200 highway deaths, according to the report.

They also estimate about 4.6 million motor-vehicle injuries required a medical consultation in 2016, an increase of 7% from 2015.\nFigures from 2014 and 2015 were gathered from the National Center for Health Statistics, but estimates for 2016 are still considered a preliminary tally, compiled by the safety council from each state's traffic authorities.\n\nMore drivers on the road\n\n\""During the recession, the number of deaths on our roadways went down a lot.

For 2016, the council estimated a 3% increase in motor-vehicle mileage over the previous year, however, this increase in traffic, unfortunately, also leads to a swelling number of highway fatalities.\n\nHowever, a 3% increase in miles driven versus a 6% increase in deaths suggests something else is at play.\n\nKolosh saw evidence that \""teenagers and young drivers were impacted and lost access to vehicles during the recession.\"" With the economy improving, teens are back on the highways, he said.\n\n\""We see actually a decrease in drivers talking on their phones -- either handheld or hands-free -- but increasingly, we're seeing drivers texting or doing other activities on their phones,\"" Kolosh said.

Although aware that it's not safe to text while driving, pedestrians think nothing of doing so while walking, said Kolosh.\n\n'Booze, belts and speed'\n\nAccording to Kara Macek, senior director of communications and programs at the Governors Highway Safety Association, road death numbers \""often fluctuate a bit year-to-year.\"" However, \""this is definitely a troubling new trend, and it's difficult to pinpoint one precise cause.\""\n\nThe association is a nonprofit representing state and territorial highway safety offices. Macek was not involved in the new safety report.\n\nMacek also points to the growing economy, which has resulted in more people driving more often. She further attributes the increasing deaths to a rise in \""our growing appetite for connectivity, which leads drivers to dangerous distractions,\"" but believes the core reasons have not changed that much.\n\n\""What's killing people on the road? It's still booze, belts and speed,\"" said Macek, who noted that in 2015, alcohol and speed were factors in 28% and 27% of fatalities, while 48% of those killed in car crashes were not buckled up.\n\nJessica Cicchino, vice president of research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent scientific and educational organization, also believes economic recovery is the main factor behind the recent increase in deaths.\n\n\""It's not just that Americans drive more miles when the economy improves. It's the kind of miles they drive,\"" said Cicchino, who did not contribute to the new report. \""What comes back after a recession is the optional driving that's riskier, like going out on the weekends or taking long trips on unfamiliar roads.\""\n\nBecause she didn't see \""a spike in cell phone use cited as a factor in fatal crashes,\"" Cicchino is less likely to blame distracted driving. However, she said, \""teens, the age group with the highest fatal crash rates per mile driven, are back on the road after the recession.\""\n\nIn addition, many states may be implementing policies that counter highway safety, according to Cicchino.\n\n\""In the last three years alone, 13 states have raised speed limits on at least some portion of their interstates,\"" she said: Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nOf these states, five states -- Maryland, Montana, South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming -- showed a diminished number of highway deaths, however the majority showed increases, suggesting her theory is mainly correct.\n\nOf all the states, Wyoming had the most improved rate, with a 25% decrease in roadway fatalities over the past two years, from 149 deaths in 2014 to 112 in 2016.\n\nWyoming, the model state\n\nLt. David Wagener of the Wyoming Highway Patrol finds it difficult to pinpoint the reason why his state is leading the nation in decreased highway fatalities.\n\""There was some slowdown in coal and other natural resource industries in Wyoming in 2016, so there were less people on the highways because of that, and there was less traffic moving, so that's one reason,\"" he said.\n\""But really,\"" he said, \""it comes down to the individual making good decisions before they get behind the wheel and good decisions when they are driving.\""\nThose good decisions include \""making sure they get enough sleep, making sure they're not driving impaired, making sure they're wearing seat belts, making sure children in the vehicle are buckled in or wearing child restraints.\""\nHis unofficial numbers match up with the estimates from the Safety Council.\n\""According to the spreadsheet I have, 55 of those 112 fatalities had a seat belt available in the vehicle they were in, yet they chose not to wear it at the time of the crash,\"" Wagener said.\n\""We have 34 listed as alcohol-related,\"" he added. Wyoming also counted 24 deaths among motorcyclists -- 39 rollover-related, nine weather-related -- and three deaths among ATV drivers.\n\nHighway Patrol Sgt. Dwayne Ellis credits the \""Alive at 25\"" program for significantly reducing the number of crashes and deaths in his state.\n\""We've taught well over 6,000 kids since the (program's) inception in late 2008, and of those, we've been able to identify only six who have died in a crash either as a driver or passenger before their 25th birthday,\"" said Ellis, who is the state's safety education coordinator.\nThough he was not able to provide numbers from 2007 to show the difference, he knows the program is extremely successful in part through feedback from both parents and young adults.\n\""What it does is, it talks about choice-making and consequences and how the choices that they make while driving not only affect them but affect everyone around them and everybody they know,\"" Ellis said. \""We empower them to think about the consequences and make good choices and let them know they are in control of their life -- it's whether they want to take control.\""\nThe class, part of a national program, is given in schools as part of the drivers education curriculum or can be taken on a volunteer basis or as an insurance deduction. Some people who have received a citation for speeding may be required by the court to take the class.\nWyoming starts them young, beginning with safety lessons in kindergarten via the \""Little Convincer.\"" This stationary platform used in presentations demonstrates how teddy bears not buckled into their seats will fall out during a crash. Then, the kids themselves can buckle themselves into the seat.\nThe adult version of the \""convincer\"" uses a rollover machine and unrestrained dummies who are ejected, flying through the air, when they're not properly buckled into place.\n\nBack on the national level, Kolosh believes the US is still doing better overall than in the past.\n\""The number of deaths on our roadways really peaked in the 1970s,\"" he said. Back then, \""a lot of the safety advances that we've all become quite accustomed to\"" had not yet taken place,\"" he noted.\n\nAt that time, the US did not have strong DUI laws or a lot of safety advances (such as airbags) in vehicles. The nation also did not have graduated programs to ease teenagers into becoming full-fledged licensed drivers.\n\n\""Our roads are much safer than they were in the '70s,\"" Kolosh said.\n""]]"

For 2016, the council estimated a 3% increase in motor-vehicle mileage over the previous year, however, this increase in traffic, unfortunately, also leads to a swelling number of highway fatalities.\n\nHowever, a 3% increase in miles driven versus a 6% increase in deaths suggests something else is at play.\n\nKolosh saw evidence that \""teenagers and young drivers were impacted and lost access to vehicles during the recession.\"" With the economy improving, teens are back on the highways, he said.\n\n\""We see actually a decrease in drivers talking on their phones -- either handheld or hands-free -- but increasingly, we're seeing drivers texting or doing other activities on their phones,\"" Kolosh said. Not surprisingly, he points to \""our younger drivers, the 15- to 24-year-olds\"" as most responsible for this shift.\n\n\""At any given daylight moment, nearly 5% of them are likely texting or doing something else on their phones while behind the wheel,\"" he said. \""We're also seeing a very, very large increase in the number of vulnerable road users who are dying on our roads.\""\n\nVulnerable road users include pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists.\nThough it's known that distracted driving is on the rise, \""the role of the distracted pedestrian\"" may be an understudied problem, according to Kolosh, who cites a 9% increase in the number of pedestrian deaths on the road between 2015 and 2016.\n\""We are pretty sure there's more distracted pedestrians in our towns, on our sidewalks, than ever before, and that's probably increasing,\"" he said. Although aware that it's not safe to text while driving, pedestrians think nothing of doing so while walking, said Kolosh.\n\n'Booze, belts and speed'\n\nAccording to Kara Macek, senior director of communications and programs at the Governors Highway Safety Association, road death numbers \""often fluctuate a bit year-to-year.\"" However, \""this is definitely a troubling new trend, and it's difficult to pinpoint one precise cause.\""\n\nThe association is a nonprofit representing state and territorial highway safety offices. Macek was not involved in the new safety report.\n\nMacek also points to the growing economy, which has resulted in more people driving more often. She further attributes the increasing deaths to a rise in \""our growing appetite for connectivity, which leads drivers to dangerous distractions,\"" but believes the core reasons have not changed that much.\n\n\""What's killing people on the road? It's still booze, belts and speed,\"" said Macek, who noted that in 2015, alcohol and speed were factors in 28% and 27% of fatalities, while 48% of those killed in car crashes were not buckled up.\n\nJessica Cicchino, vice president of research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent scientific and educational organization, also believes economic recovery is the main factor behind the recent increase in deaths.\n\n\""It's not just that Americans drive more miles when the economy improves. It's the kind of miles they drive,\"" said Cicchino, who did not contribute to the new report. \""What comes back after a recession is the optional driving that's riskier, like going out on the weekends or taking long trips on unfamiliar roads.\""\n\nBecause she didn't see \""a spike in cell phone use cited as a factor in fatal crashes,\"" Cicchino is less likely to blame distracted driving. However, she said, \""teens, the age group with the highest fatal crash rates per mile driven, are back on the road after the recession.\""\n\nIn addition, many states may be implementing policies that counter highway safety, according to Cicchino.\n\n\""In the last three years alone, 13 states have raised speed limits on at least some portion of their interstates,\"" she said: Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nOf these states, five states -- Maryland, Montana, South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming -- showed a diminished number of highway deaths, however the majority showed increases, suggesting her theory is mainly correct.\n\nOf all the states, Wyoming had the most improved rate, with a 25% decrease in roadway fatalities over the past two years, from 149 deaths in 2014 to 112 in 2016.\n\nWyoming, the model state\n\nLt. David Wagener of the Wyoming Highway Patrol finds it difficult to pinpoint the reason why his state is leading the nation in decreased highway fatalities.\n\""There was some slowdown in coal and other natural resource industries in Wyoming in 2016, so there were less people on the highways because of that, and there was less traffic moving, so that's one reason,\"" he said.\n\""But really,\"" he said, \""it comes down to the individual making good decisions before they get behind the wheel and good decisions when they are driving.\""\nThose good decisions include \""making sure they get enough sleep, making sure they're not driving impaired, making sure they're wearing seat belts, making sure children in the vehicle are buckled in or wearing child restraints.\""\nHis unofficial numbers match up with the estimates from the Safety Council.\n\""According to the spreadsheet I have, 55 of those 112 fatalities had a seat belt available in the vehicle they were in, yet they chose not to wear it at the time of the crash,\"" Wagener said.\n\""We have 34 listed as alcohol-related,\"" he added. Wyoming also counted 24 deaths among motorcyclists -- 39 rollover-related, nine weather-related -- and three deaths among ATV drivers.\n\nHighway Patrol Sgt. Dwayne Ellis credits the \""Alive at 25\"" program for significantly reducing the number of crashes and deaths in his state.\n\""We've taught well over 6,000 kids since the (program's) inception in late 2008, and of those, we've been able to identify only six who have died in a crash either as a driver or passenger before their 25th birthday,\"" said Ellis, who is the state's safety education coordinator.\nThough he was not able to provide numbers from 2007 to show the difference, he knows the program is extremely successful in part through feedback from both parents and young adults.\n\""What it does is, it talks about choice-making and consequences and how the choices that they make while driving not only affect them but affect everyone around them and everybody they know,\"" Ellis said. \""We empower them to think about the consequences and make good choices and let them know they are in control of their life -- it's whether they want to take control.\""\nThe class, part of a national program, is given in schools as part of the drivers education curriculum or can be taken on a volunteer basis or as an insurance deduction. Some people who have received a citation for speeding may be required by the court to take the class.\nWyoming starts them young, beginning with safety lessons in kindergarten via the \""Little Convincer.\"" This stationary platform used in presentations demonstrates how teddy bears not buckled into their seats will fall out during a crash. Then, the kids themselves can buckle themselves into the seat.\nThe adult version of the \""convincer\"" uses a rollover machine and unrestrained dummies who are ejected, flying through the air, when they're not properly buckled into place.\n\nBack on the national level, Kolosh believes the US is still doing better overall than in the past.\n\""The number of deaths on our roadways really peaked in the 1970s,\"" he said. Back then, \""a lot of the safety advances that we've all become quite accustomed to\"" had not yet taken place,\"" he noted.\n\nAt that time, the US did not have strong DUI laws or a lot of safety advances (such as airbags) in vehicles. The nation also did not have graduated programs to ease teenagers into becoming full-fledged licensed drivers.\n\n\""Our roads are much safer than they were in the '70s,\"" Kolosh said.\n""]]"

No one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know it's going to rise tomorrow. When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it's always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.”\n\n― Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\n\nCleveland Cavaliers basketball star Kyrie Irving has apparently joined the dubious celebrity ranks of former The View host Sherri Shepherd, rapper B.o.B., and reality TV personality Tila Tequila by coming out in public to declare that the world is flat.\n\nIn a recent podcast leading up to the 2017 NBA All-Star Weekend, Irving said:\n\n“For what I’ve known for many years and what I’ve been taught is that the Earth is round, but if you really think about it from a landscape of the way we travel, the way we move and the fact that — can you really think of us rotating around the sun, and all planets align, rotating in specific dates, being perpendicular with what’s going on with these planets and stuff like this.”\n\nWith this quotation, Deadspin magazine ran the headline, “Kyrie Irving Really, Actually, Earnestly Believes The Earth Is Flat.”\n\nBut does Irving, who spent his freshman year at Duke University before leaving for professional basketball, really, actually, and earnestly believe the earth is flat? Does anyone?\n\nWhile it’s often said that human beings believed that the Earth was flat through the Middle Ages until Christopher Columbus set us straight in 1492, a more historically accurate account tells us that civilization had abandoned flat Earth theories at least a century before that. Educated people have therefore accepted that the world is round for more than half a millennium, with modern claims to the contrary only developing as an organizational creed when Samuel Shenton founded the International Flat Earth Research Society in 1956. Despite NASA astronauts returning with photographs of the Earth taken from the moon in 1969, the membership of the International Flat Earth Research Society peaked to 3500 members in the 1990s and now, with like-minded individuals finding each other on the internet, a number of different online “Flat Earth Societies” have gained modest followings. Armed as we are with common sense, a little bit of scientific knowledge, and the ability to fly around the Earth in an airplane and to view images taken from satellites and the International Space Station, how is this possible? How can people really believe that the Earth isn’t round?\n\nTo understand Flat Earthers, and other people who hold unconventional beliefs, we need to first consider what it means to “believe.” A belief is a cognitive representation of the nature of reality, encompassing our inner experiences, the world around us, and the world beyond. In 1965, Oxford philosophy professor H.H. Price distinguished between “believing in” and “believing that.”1 As summarized by John Byrne, author of the website Skeptical Medicine, “believing that” something is true is a relatively straightforward matter of looking at the evidence. “Seeing is believing” is one kind of “believing that.” In contrast, we “believe in” something when there’s no evidence and the belief isn’t falsifiable. Religious faith is a kind of “believing in.” Both types of believing are normal cognitive capacities, but can run amok when conflated, resulting in beliefs that are poor models of reality.\n\nJust so, Flat Earthers often talk about planetary geometry in terms of “belief in” rather than “belief that,” as if the evidence for a spherical Earth is lacking. But that claim isn’t really so much about believing. It's denialism.\n\nWhen Kyrie Irving was challenged about his flat earth beliefs, he replied:\n\n“Is the world flat or round? — I think you need to do research on it. It’s right in front of our faces. I’m telling you it’s right in front of our faces. They lie to us… Everything that was put in front of me, I had to be like, ‘Oh, this is all a facade.’ Like, this is all something that they ultimately want me to believe in… Question things, but even if an answer doesn’t come back, you’re perfectly fine with that, because you were never living in that particular truth. There’s a falseness in stories and things that people want you to believe and ultimately what they throw in front of us.”\n\nWith those words, Irving seems to be defending a denialist position that has the potential to give way to a slippery slope of rejecting all facts. According to that extreme version of denialism, nothing can be trusted, not even scientific evidence. Or maybe, as the physician and writer Atul Gawande wrote last year, it’s not so much about mistrust of science, as it is about mistrusting scientists:\n\n“Today, we have multiple factions putting themselves forward as what Gauchat describes as their own cultural domains, “generating their own knowledge base that is often in conflict with the cultural authority of the scientific community.” Some are religious groups (challenging evolution, for instance). Some are industry groups (as with climate skepticism). Others tilt more to the left (such as those that reject the medical establishment). As varied as these groups are, they are all alike in one way. They all harbor sacred beliefs that they do not consider open to question.\n\nTo defend those beliefs, few dismiss the authority of science. They dismiss the authority of the scientific community. People don’t argue back by claiming divine authority anymore. They argue back by claiming to have the truer scientific authority. It can make matters incredibly confusing.”\n\nSure enough, in a follow-up interview in which a reporter asked Irving if he’d seen photographs of the Earth from space, he replied, “I’ve seen a lot of things that my educational system said was real, but turned out to be completely fake.”\n\nThat kind of conspiratorial mistrust of established dogma was mirrored in a Paste magazine interview last year with John Davis, President of the American Flat Earth Society. When asked why he believed the world to be flat, Davis instead explained how he’d arrived at that belief:\n\n“One day while walking in the woods as a young man I had a notable experience that lead me to question everything I’ve taken for granted as true over the years; all those things we simply accept without properly examining their logical and rational basis and foundations. One could say like many today that up to this point I was standing on the shoulders of giants, but I had a deaf ear to both what they had to say about the matter as well as what assumptions they had to take to lead them to their position. This led me to a lengthy study into various ways we view the world, both orthodox and unorthodox, and their rational consequences and foundations. During this period of study and examination I came to some literature from the Flat Earth Society.\n\nSomething about it just resonated with me—not only on a personal level, but also on a strictly logical level.\n\nOn another level, it seemed to me that some of the method used by this supposedly ridiculous group was far closer to the method of the aforementioned giants than what we see today from science as a whole. I remember thinking, ‘These are people who truly value knowledge, and they do so at a real cost—social stigma.’”\n\nThis account suggests that Flat Earthers often see themselves as approaching questions about reality like scientists do, from a philosophical perspective of skepticism. But while superficially related, scientific skepticism and denialism aren’t the same thing at all.2 The former teaches that evidence is worthy of belief when an observation is repeated under properly controlled conditions, while the latter teaches that evidence, no matter how reproducible, can always be rejected out of hand as a matter of principle (for more on the distinction, check out Michael Shermer's Living in Denial: When a Sceptic Isn't a Sceptic and Steven Novella's Skepticism and Denial).\n\nWhen B.o.B. and Tila Tequila defended their flat earth beliefs, both fell back on the claim that the Earth can’t be round because it appears flat on the horizon. While this position could be dismissed as mere ignorance grounded in the natural but error-prone tendency of the brain to treat perception as reality, the simultaneous rejection of the mountain of objective evidence to the contrary may further reflect a modern democratization of opinion, with personal belief placed on a equal footing with expertise. That kind of narcissism emboldened B.o.B. to feel qualified to debate physicist Neil Degrasse Tyson and for many others seems to be an increasingly adopted epistemology in today's “post-truth” world.\n\nSo, does Kyrie Irving really, actually, and earnestly believe that if he kept going in a straight line, he would eventually run smack into the end of the Earth? I doubt it.\n\nInstead, he seems to have chosen a provocative example of scientific consensus to argue, perhaps with tongue in cheek, that we should seek truth and question authority along the way. That’s reasonable advice, so long as we maintain a clear boundary between scientific skepticism and nihilistic denialism.\n\nIn terms of psychological and social health, we would all do well to be more flexible with our personal belief convictions, keeping an open mind to the possibility that we might be wrong. But at the same time, we would also do well to “believe in” the process of “believing that.” According to that advice, denialism holds us back, tethering us to false beliefs that are inconsistent with the facts and worthy of ridicule.""]]"

No one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know it's going to rise tomorrow. When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it's always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.”\n\n― Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\n\nCleveland Cavaliers basketball star Kyrie Irving has apparently joined the dubious celebrity ranks of former The View host Sherri Shepherd, rapper B.o.B., and reality TV personality Tila Tequila by coming out in public to declare that the world is flat.\n\nIn a recent podcast leading up to the 2017 NBA All-Star Weekend, Irving said:\n\n“For what I’ve known for many years and what I’ve been taught is that the Earth is round, but if you really think about it from a landscape of the way we travel, the way we move and the fact that — can you really think of us rotating around the sun, and all planets align, rotating in specific dates, being perpendicular with what’s going on with these planets and stuff like this.”\n\nWith this quotation, Deadspin magazine ran the headline, “Kyrie Irving Really, Actually, Earnestly Believes The Earth Is Flat.”\n\nBut does Irving, who spent his freshman year at Duke University before leaving for professional basketball, really, actually, and earnestly believe the earth is flat? Does anyone?\n\nWhile it’s often said that human beings believed that the Earth was flat through the Middle Ages until Christopher Columbus set us straight in 1492, a more historically accurate account tells us that civilization had abandoned flat Earth theories at least a century before that. Educated people have therefore accepted that the world is round for more than half a millennium, with modern claims to the contrary only developing as an organizational creed when Samuel Shenton founded the International Flat Earth Research Society in 1956. Despite NASA astronauts returning with photographs of the Earth taken from the moon in 1969, the membership of the International Flat Earth Research Society peaked to 3500 members in the 1990s and now, with like-minded individuals finding each other on the internet, a number of different online “Flat Earth Societies” have gained modest followings. Armed as we are with common sense, a little bit of scientific knowledge, and the ability to fly around the Earth in an airplane and to view images taken from satellites and the International Space Station, how is this possible? How can people really believe that the Earth isn’t round?\n\nTo understand Flat Earthers, and other people who hold unconventional beliefs, we need to first consider what it means to “believe.” A belief is a cognitive representation of the nature of reality, encompassing our inner experiences, the world around us, and the world beyond. In 1965, Oxford philosophy professor H.H. Price distinguished between “believing in” and “believing that.”1 As summarized by John Byrne, author of the website Skeptical Medicine, “believing that” something is true is a relatively straightforward matter of looking at the evidence. “Seeing is believing” is one kind of “believing that.” In contrast, we “believe in” something when there’s no evidence and the belief isn’t falsifiable. Religious faith is a kind of “believing in.” Both types of believing are normal cognitive capacities, but can run amok when conflated, resulting in beliefs that are poor models of reality.\n\nJust so, Flat Earthers often talk about planetary geometry in terms of “belief in” rather than “belief that,” as if the evidence for a spherical Earth is lacking. But that claim isn’t really so much about believing. It's denialism.\n\nWhen Kyrie Irving was challenged about his flat earth beliefs, he replied:\n\n“Is the world flat or round? — I think you need to do research on it. It’s right in front of our faces. I’m telling you it’s right in front of our faces. They lie to us… Everything that was put in front of me, I had to be like, ‘Oh, this is all a facade.’ Like, this is all something that they ultimately want me to believe in… Question things, but even if an answer doesn’t come back, you’re perfectly fine with that, because you were never living in that particular truth. There’s a falseness in stories and things that people want you to believe and ultimately what they throw in front of us.”\n\nWith those words, Irving seems to be defending a denialist position that has the potential to give way to a slippery slope of rejecting all facts. According to that extreme version of denialism, nothing can be trusted, not even scientific evidence. Or maybe, as the physician and writer Atul Gawande wrote last year, it’s not so much about mistrust of science, as it is about mistrusting scientists:\n\n“Today, we have multiple factions putting themselves forward as what Gauchat describes as their own cultural domains, “generating their own knowledge base that is often in conflict with the cultural authority of the scientific community.” Some are religious groups (challenging evolution, for instance). Some are industry groups (as with climate skepticism). Others tilt more to the left (such as those that reject the medical establishment). As varied as these groups are, they are all alike in one way. They all harbor sacred beliefs that they do not consider open to question.\n\nTo defend those beliefs, few dismiss the authority of science. They dismiss the authority of the scientific community. People don’t argue back by claiming divine authority anymore. They argue back by claiming to have the truer scientific authority. It can make matters incredibly confusing.”\n\nSure enough, in a follow-up interview in which a reporter asked Irving if he’d seen photographs of the Earth from space, he replied, “I’ve seen a lot of things that my educational system said was real, but turned out to be completely fake.”\n\nThat kind of conspiratorial mistrust of established dogma was mirrored in a Paste magazine interview last year with John Davis, President of the American Flat Earth Society. When asked why he believed the world to be flat, Davis instead explained how he’d arrived at that belief:\n\n“One day while walking in the woods as a young man I had a notable experience that lead me to question everything I’ve taken for granted as true over the years; all those things we simply accept without properly examining their logical and rational basis and foundations. One could say like many today that up to this point I was standing on the shoulders of giants, but I had a deaf ear to both what they had to say about the matter as well as what assumptions they had to take to lead them to their position. This led me to a lengthy study into various ways we view the world, both orthodox and unorthodox, and their rational consequences and foundations. During this period of study and examination I came to some literature from the Flat Earth Society.\n\nSomething about it just resonated with me—not only on a personal level, but also on a strictly logical level.\n\nOn another level, it seemed to me that some of the method used by this supposedly ridiculous group was far closer to the method of the aforementioned giants than what we see today from science as a whole. I remember thinking, ‘These are people who truly value knowledge, and they do so at a real cost—social stigma.’”\n\nThis account suggests that Flat Earthers often see themselves as approaching questions about reality like scientists do, from a philosophical perspective of skepticism. But while superficially related, scientific skepticism and denialism aren’t the same thing at all.2 The former teaches that evidence is worthy of belief when an observation is repeated under properly controlled conditions, while the latter teaches that evidence, no matter how reproducible, can always be rejected out of hand as a matter of principle (for more on the distinction, check out Michael Shermer's Living in Denial: When a Sceptic Isn't a Sceptic and Steven Novella's Skepticism and Denial).\n\nWhen B.o.B. and Tila Tequila defended their flat earth beliefs, both fell back on the claim that the Earth can’t be round because it appears flat on the horizon. While this position could be dismissed as mere ignorance grounded in the natural but error-prone tendency of the brain to treat perception as reality, the simultaneous rejection of the mountain of objective evidence to the contrary may further reflect a modern democratization of opinion, with personal belief placed on a equal footing with expertise. That kind of narcissism emboldened B.o.B. to feel qualified to debate physicist Neil Degrasse Tyson and for many others seems to be an increasingly adopted epistemology in today's “post-truth” world.\n\nSo, does Kyrie Irving really, actually, and earnestly believe that if he kept going in a straight line, he would eventually run smack into the end of the Earth? I doubt it.\n\nInstead, he seems to have chosen a provocative example of scientific consensus to argue, perhaps with tongue in cheek, that we should seek truth and question authority along the way. That’s reasonable advice, so long as we maintain a clear boundary between scientific skepticism and nihilistic denialism.\n\nIn terms of psychological and social health, we would all do well to be more flexible with our personal belief convictions, keeping an open mind to the possibility that we might be wrong. But at the same time, we would also do well to “believe in” the process of “believing that.” According to that advice, denialism holds us back, tethering us to false beliefs that are inconsistent with the facts and worthy of ridicule.""]]"

No one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know it's going to rise tomorrow. When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it's always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.”\n\n― Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\n\nCleveland Cavaliers basketball star Kyrie Irving has apparently joined the dubious celebrity ranks of former The View host Sherri Shepherd, rapper B.o.B., and reality TV personality Tila Tequila by coming out in public to declare that the world is flat.\n\nIn a recent podcast leading up to the 2017 NBA All-Star Weekend, Irving said:\n\n“For what I’ve known for many years and what I’ve been taught is that the Earth is round, but if you really think about it from a landscape of the way we travel, the way we move and the fact that — can you really think of us rotating around the sun, and all planets align, rotating in specific dates, being perpendicular with what’s going on with these planets and stuff like this.”\n\nWith this quotation, Deadspin magazine ran the headline, “Kyrie Irving Really, Actually, Earnestly Believes The Earth Is Flat.”\n\nBut does Irving, who spent his freshman year at Duke University before leaving for professional basketball, really, actually, and earnestly believe the earth is flat? Does anyone?\n\nWhile it’s often said that human beings believed that the Earth was flat through the Middle Ages until Christopher Columbus set us straight in 1492, a more historically accurate account tells us that civilization had abandoned flat Earth theories at least a century before that. Educated people have therefore accepted that the world is round for more than half a millennium, with modern claims to the contrary only developing as an organizational creed when Samuel Shenton founded the International Flat Earth Research Society in 1956. Despite NASA astronauts returning with photographs of the Earth taken from the moon in 1969, the membership of the International Flat Earth Research Society peaked to 3500 members in the 1990s and now, with like-minded individuals finding each other on the internet, a number of different online “Flat Earth Societies” have gained modest followings.

But now physicists are questioning the conclusion, and they have a much larger dataset to back them up.\n\nFor a bit of background on the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, it was shared between cosmologists Saul Perlmutter from the University of California, Berkeley; Adam Riess from Johns Hopkins University; and Brian Schmidt from the Australian National University.\n\nDuring the 1990s, these three scientists were part of competing teams that were measuring distant Type 1a supernovae - the violent end of a type of star called a white dwarf.\n\nWhite dwarf stars are made from one of the densest forms of matter in the known Universe - surpassed only by neutron stars and black holes.\n\nWhile a typical white dwarf will only be slightly larger than Earth, it will have around the same amount of mass as our Sun. To put that into perspective, you could fit roughly 1,300,000 Earths inside the Sun. \n\nNow imagine that incredibly dense, dead star collapsing under the weight of its own gravity. We're talking about a luminosity level that's about 5 billion times brighter than the Sun.\n\nBecause each Type 1a supernova explodes with roughly the same brightness, the amount of light they give off can be used as an indication of their distance from Earth - and slight shifts in colour can also be used to figure out how fast they're moving.\n\nWhen Perlmutter, Riess, and Schmidt measured all the data for known Type 1a supernovae, recorded by the Hubble space telescope and a number of large ground-based telescopes, they found something incredibly strange. \n\nAs the Royal Swedish Academy explained on the morning of the Nobel Prize announcement in Stockholm:\n\n\""In a Universe which is dominated by matter, one would expect gravity eventually should make the expansion slow down. Imagine then the utter astonishment when two groups of scientists ... discovered that the expansion was not slowing down, it was actually accelerating.\n\nBy comparing the brightness of distant, far-away supernovae with the brightness of nearby supernovae, the scientists discovered that the far-away supernovae were about 25 percent too faint. They were too far away. The Universe was accelerating. And so this discovery is fundamental and a milestone for cosmology. And a challenge for generations of scientists to come.\"" \n\nThe find was backed up by data collected separately on things like clustering galaxies and the cosmic microwave background - the faint afterglow of the Big Bang. \n\nAnd earlier this year, NASA and ESA scientists found that the Universe could be expanding around 8 percent faster than originally thought.\n\nBy all accounts, the discovery was a solid one (Nobel Prize solid) but it posed a very difficult question - if the collective gravity from all the matter expelled into the Universe by the Big Bang has been slowing everything down, how can it be accelerating?\n\nAs Brendan Cole reported for us in May:\n\n\""There's something pervading the Universe that physically spreads space apart faster than gravity can pull things together. The effect is small - it's only noticeable when you look at far-away galaxies - but it's there.

But now physicists are questioning the conclusion, and they have a much larger dataset to back them up.\n\nFor a bit of background on the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, it was shared between cosmologists Saul Perlmutter from the University of California, Berkeley; Adam Riess from Johns Hopkins University; and Brian Schmidt from the Australian National University.\n\nDuring the 1990s, these three scientists were part of competing teams that were measuring distant Type 1a supernovae - the violent end of a type of star called a white dwarf.\n\nWhite dwarf stars are made from one of the densest forms of matter in the known Universe - surpassed only by neutron stars and black holes.\n\nWhile a typical white dwarf will only be slightly larger than Earth, it will have around the same amount of mass as our Sun. To put that into perspective, you could fit roughly 1,300,000 Earths inside the Sun. \n\nNow imagine that incredibly dense, dead star collapsing under the weight of its own gravity. We're talking about a luminosity level that's about 5 billion times brighter than the Sun.\n\nBecause each Type 1a supernova explodes with roughly the same brightness, the amount of light they give off can be used as an indication of their distance from Earth - and slight shifts in colour can also be used to figure out how fast they're moving.\n\nWhen Perlmutter, Riess, and Schmidt measured all the data for known Type 1a supernovae, recorded by the Hubble space telescope and a number of large ground-based telescopes, they found something incredibly strange. \n\nAs the Royal Swedish Academy explained on the morning of the Nobel Prize announcement in Stockholm:\n\n\""In a Universe which is dominated by matter, one would expect gravity eventually should make the expansion slow down.

But now physicists are questioning the conclusion, and they have a much larger dataset to back them up.\n\nFor a bit of background on the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, it was shared between cosmologists Saul Perlmutter from the University of California, Berkeley; Adam Riess from Johns Hopkins University; and Brian Schmidt from the Australian National University.\n\nDuring the 1990s, these three scientists were part of competing teams that were measuring distant Type 1a supernovae - the violent end of a type of star called a white dwarf.\n\nWhite dwarf stars are made from one of the densest forms of matter in the known Universe - surpassed only by neutron stars and black holes.\n\nWhile a typical white dwarf will only be slightly larger than Earth, it will have around the same amount of mass as our Sun. To put that into perspective, you could fit roughly 1,300,000 Earths inside the Sun. \n\nNow imagine that incredibly dense, dead star collapsing under the weight of its own gravity. We're talking about a luminosity level that's about 5 billion times brighter than the Sun.\n\nBecause each Type 1a supernova explodes with roughly the same brightness, the amount of light they give off can be used as an indication of their distance from Earth - and slight shifts in colour can also be used to figure out how fast they're moving.\n\nWhen Perlmutter, Riess, and Schmidt measured all the data for known Type 1a supernovae, recorded by the Hubble space telescope and a number of large ground-based telescopes, they found something incredibly strange. \n\nAs the Royal Swedish Academy explained on the morning of the Nobel Prize announcement in Stockholm:\n\n\""In a Universe which is dominated by matter, one would expect gravity eventually should make the expansion slow down. Imagine then the utter astonishment when two groups of scientists ... discovered that the expansion was not slowing down, it was actually accelerating.\n\nBy comparing the brightness of distant, far-away supernovae with the brightness of nearby supernovae, the scientists discovered that the far-away supernovae were about 25 percent too faint. They were too far away. The Universe was accelerating. And so this discovery is fundamental and a milestone for cosmology. And a challenge for generations of scientists to come.\"" \n\nThe find was backed up by data collected separately on things like clustering galaxies and the cosmic microwave background - the faint afterglow of the Big Bang. \n\nAnd earlier this year, NASA and ESA scientists found that the Universe could be expanding around 8 percent faster than originally thought.\n\nBy all accounts, the discovery was a solid one (Nobel Prize solid) but it posed a very difficult question - if the collective gravity from all the matter expelled into the Universe by the Big Bang has been slowing everything down, how can it be accelerating?\n\nAs Brendan Cole reported for us in May:\n\n\""There's something pervading the Universe that physically spreads space apart faster than gravity can pull things together. The effect is small - it's only noticeable when you look at far-away galaxies - but it's there. It's become known as dark energy - 'dark', because no one knows what it is.\""\n\nSince scientists first proposed dark energy, no one's gotten any closer to figuring out what it could actually be.\n\nBut now an international team of physicists have questioned the acceration of the Universe's expansion, and they've got a much bigger database of Type 1a supernovae to back them up.\n\nBy applying a different analytical model to the 740 Type Ia supernovae that have been identified so far, the team says they've been able to account for the subtle differences between them like never before.\n\nThey say the statistical techniques used by the original team were too simplistic, and were based on a model devised in the 1930s, which can't reliability be applied to the growing supernova dataset.\n\nThey also mention that the cosmic microwave background isn't directly affected by dark energy, so only serves as an \""indirect\"" type of evidence.\n\n\""We analysed the latest catalogue of 740 Type Ia supernovae - over 10 times bigger than the original samples on which the discovery claim was based - and found that the evidence for accelerated expansion is, at most, what physicists call '3 sigma',\"" reports lead researcher, Subir Sarkar, from the University of Oxford.\n\n\""This is far short of the '5 sigma' standard required to claim a discovery of fundamental significance.\""\n\nInstead of finding evidence to support the accelerated expansion of the Universe, Sarkar and his team say it looks like the Universe is expanding at a constant rate. If that's truly the case, it means we don't need dark energy to explain it.\n\n\""A more sophisticated theoretical framework accounting for the observation that the Universe is not exactly homogeneous, and that its matter content may not behave as an ideal gas - two key assumptions of standard cosmology - may well be able to account for all observations without requiring dark energy,\"" he says.\n\nNow, to be clear, this is just one study, and it's a big, extremely controversial claim that a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is fundamentally wrong. (Because I don't have to tell you that Nobel Prizes aren't given out lightly.) \n\nBut replication of results is everything in science, and if we have a larger dataset to go on than we did five years ago, we should use it to support - or correct - previous discoveries.\n\nThe question now is whether Sarkar's team applied their new statistical model to the data in a way that best reflects the science, and it will likely spur on a whole lot of physicists to figure out which is right - accelerating Universe, or constant Universe.\n\n\""Naturally, a lot of work will be necessary to convince the physics community of this, but our work serves to demonstrate that a key pillar of the standard cosmological model is rather shaky,\"" says Sarkar.\n\n\""Hopefully, this will motivate better analyses of cosmological data, as well as inspiring theorists to investigate more nuanced cosmological models.\"" ""]]"

To Forget, Scientists Say\n\nauthor: Carl Zimmer\n\nDate: FEB. 2, 2017\n\nOver the years, scientists have come up with a lot of ideas about why we sleep.\n\nSome have argued that it’s a way to save energy. Others have suggested that slumber provides an opportunity to clear away the brain’s cellular waste. Still others have proposed that sleep simply forces animals to lie still, letting them hide from predators.\n\nA pair of papers published on Thursday in the journal Science offer evidence for another notion: We sleep to forget some of the things we learn each day.\n\nIn order to learn, we have to grow connections, or synapses, between the neurons in our brains. These connections enable neurons to send signals to one another quickly and efficiently. We store new memories in these networks.\n\nIn 2003, Giulio Tononi and Chiara Cirelli, biologists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, proposed that synapses grew so exuberantly during the day that our brain circuits got “noisy.” When we sleep, the scientists argued, our brains pare back the connections to lift the signal over the noise.\n\nContinue reading the main story\nIn the years since, Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli, along with other researchers, have found a great deal of indirect evidence to support the so-called synaptic homeostasis hypothesis.\n\nIt turns out, for example, that neurons can prune their synapses — at least in a dish. In laboratory experiments on clumps of neurons, scientists can give them a drug that spurs them to grow extra synapses. Afterward, the neurons pare back some of the growth.\n\nOther evidence comes from the electric waves released by the brain. During deep sleep, the waves slow down. Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli have argued that shrinking synapses produce this change.\n\nFour years ago, Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli got a chance to test their theory by looking at the synapses themselves. They acquired a kind of deli slicer for brain tissue, which they used to shave ultrathin sheets from a mouse’s brain.\n\nLuisa de Vivo, an assistant scientist working in their lab, led a painstaking survey of tissue taken from mice, some awake and others asleep. She and her colleagues determined the size and shape of 6,920 synapses in total.\n\nThe synapses in the brains of sleeping mice, they found, were 18 percent smaller than in awake ones. “That there’s such a big change over all is surprising,” Dr. Tononi said.\n\nThe second study was led by Graham H. Diering, a postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Diering and his colleagues set out to explore the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis by studying the proteins in mouse brains. “I’m really coming at it from this nuts-and-bolts place,” Dr. Diering said.\n\nIn one experiment, Dr. Diering and his colleagues created a tiny window through which they could peer into mouse brains. Then he and his colleagues added a chemical that lit up a surface protein on brain synapses.\n\nLooking through the window, they found that the number of surface proteins dropped during sleep. That decline is what you would expect if the synapses were shrinking.\n\nDr. Diering and his colleagues then searched for the molecular trigger for this change. They found that hundreds of proteins increase or decrease inside of synapses during the night. But one protein in particular, called Homer1A, stood out.\n\nIn earlier experiments on neurons in a dish, Homer1A proved to be important for paring back synapses. Dr. Diering wondered if it was important in sleep, too.\n\nTo find out, he and his colleagues studied mice genetically engineered so that they couldn’t make Homer1A proteins. These mice slept like ordinary mice, but their synapses didn’t change their proteins like the ones in ordinary mice.\n\nDr. Diering’s research suggests that sleepiness triggers neurons to make Homer1A and ship it into their synapses. When sleep arrives, Homer1A turns on the pruning machinery.\n\nTo see how this pruning machinery affects learning, the scientists gave regular mice a memory test. They put the animals in a room where they got a mild electric shock if they walked over one section of the floor.\n\nThat night, the scientists injected a chemical into the brains of some of the mice. The chemical had been shown to block neurons in dishes from pruning their synapses.\n\nThe next day, the scientists put all the mice back in the chamber they had been in before. Both groups of mice spent much of the time frozen, fearfully recalling the shock.\n\nBut when the researchers put the mice in a different chamber, they saw a big difference. The ordinary mice sniffed around curiously. The mice that had been prevented from pruning their brain synapses during sleep, on the other hand, froze once again.\n\nDr. Diering thinks that the injected mice couldn’t narrow their memories down to the particular chamber where they had gotten the shock. Without nighttime pruning, their memories ended up fuzzy.\n\nIn their own experiment, Dr. Tononi and his colleagues found that the pruning didn’t strike every neuron. A fifth of the synapses were unchanged. It’s possible that these synapses encode well-established memories that shouldn’t be tampered with.\n\n“You can forget in a smart way,” Dr. Tononi said.\n\nOther researchers cautioned that the new findings weren’t definitive proof of the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis.\n\nMarcos G. Frank, a sleep researcher at Washington State University in Spokane, said that it could be hard to tell whether changes to the brain at night were caused by sleep or by the biological clock. “It’s a general problem in the field,” he said.\n\nMarkus H. Schmidt, of the Ohio Sleep Medicine Institute, said that while the brain might prune synapses during sleep, he questioned whether this was the main explanation for why sleep exists.\n\n“The work is great,” he said of the new studies, “but the question is, is this a function of sleep or is it the function?”\n\nMany organs, not just the brain, seem to function differently during sleep, Dr. Schmidt pointed out. The gut appears to make many new cells, for example.\n\nDr. Tononi said that the new findings should prompt a look at what current sleeping drugs do in the brain. While they may be good at making people sleepy, it’s also possible that they may interfere with the pruning required for forming memories.\n\n“You may actually work against yourself,” Dr. Tononi said.\n\nIn the future, sleep medicines might precisely target the molecules involved in sleep, ensuring that synapses get properly pruned.\n\n“Once you know a little bit of what happens at the ground-truth level, you can get a better idea of what to do for therapy,” Dr. Tononi said.\n\n""]]"

To Forget, Scientists Say\n\nauthor: Carl Zimmer\n\nDate: FEB. 2, 2017\n\nOver the years, scientists have come up with a lot of ideas about why we sleep.\n\nSome have argued that it’s a way to save energy. Others have suggested that slumber provides an opportunity to clear away the brain’s cellular waste. Still others have proposed that sleep simply forces animals to lie still, letting them hide from predators.\n\nA pair of papers published on Thursday in the journal Science offer evidence for another notion: We sleep to forget some of the things we learn each day.\n\nIn order to learn, we have to grow connections, or synapses, between the neurons in our brains. These connections enable neurons to send signals to one another quickly and efficiently. We store new memories in these networks.\n\nIn 2003, Giulio Tononi and Chiara Cirelli, biologists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, proposed that synapses grew so exuberantly during the day that our brain circuits got “noisy.” When we sleep, the scientists argued, our brains pare back the connections to lift the signal over the noise.\n\nContinue reading the main story\nIn the years since, Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli, along with other researchers, have found a great deal of indirect evidence to support the so-called synaptic homeostasis hypothesis.\n\nIt turns out, for example, that neurons can prune their synapses — at least in a dish. In laboratory experiments on clumps of neurons, scientists can give them a drug that spurs them to grow extra synapses. Afterward, the neurons pare back some of the growth.\n\nOther evidence comes from the electric waves released by the brain. During deep sleep, the waves slow down. Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli have argued that shrinking synapses produce this change.\n\nFour years ago, Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli got a chance to test their theory by looking at the synapses themselves. They acquired a kind of deli slicer for brain tissue, which they used to shave ultrathin sheets from a mouse’s brain.\n\nLuisa de Vivo, an assistant scientist working in their lab, led a painstaking survey of tissue taken from mice, some awake and others asleep. She and her colleagues determined the size and shape of 6,920 synapses in total.\n\nThe synapses in the brains of sleeping mice, they found, were 18 percent smaller than in awake ones. “That there’s such a big change over all is surprising,” Dr. Tononi said.\n\nThe second study was led by Graham H. Diering, a postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Diering and his colleagues set out to explore the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis by studying the proteins in mouse brains. “I’m really coming at it from this nuts-and-bolts place,” Dr. Diering said.\n\nIn one experiment, Dr. Diering and his colleagues created a tiny window through which they could peer into mouse brains.

Normally, the animals woke and slept on a 12-hour cycle. When the lights were on in the lab, the mice were active. When it went dark on a timer, down they went. But Zielinski, who teaches psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, had recently tweaked their schedule to keep the mice up past their bedtime.\n\nZielinski and his colleagues would rustle the bedding in the mice's cages to keep them from dozing off when they started to display the telltale signs of sleepiness—drooping lids, sluggish walk, EEG readings showing their brain activity was waning. But Zielinski noticed that when the mice were left alone to slumber at will after the disruption, they didn't, or perhaps couldn't, fall asleep.\n\nThat the sleep-deprived rodents slept less than they normally would didn't really surprise Zielinski. The mice had a genetic mutation that he suspected was linked to sleep problems. More striking were the electrical brain readings showing that even when they did sleep, they weren't getting the deep, restorative kind of rest that doctors say matters most—not just to rodents but also to humans.\n\nIn the right conditions, researchers believe, the brain produces a signal that essentially tells the body's major systems—the heart, the lungs, the digestive system, the nervous system, even the muscles—that it's time to call it quits for the day. Zielinski's research has found that, just as with the mice with the mutation, it's likely that in some people with chronic sleep problems, that critical signal isn't firing.\n\nUnderstanding what's behind some forms of insomnia, an aim of Zielinski's research, is a major step in learning how to fix it. That's a big deal in sleep research, because evidence linking quality rest to good health and longevity has never been more convincing.\n\nScientists are learning that shortchanging sleep can compromise nearly every major body system, from the brain to the heart to the immune system, making our inability—or unwillingness—to sleep enough one of the unhealthiest things we can do.\nStudies of people whose sleep sessions are irregular or short show they are at higher risk of developing diseases that can lead to early death, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. Poor sleep may have detrimental effects on the brain as well, increasing the risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, as well as mood disorders like depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. And like smoking, a terrible diet and not exercising enough, poor sleep is now linked to an overall increased risk of premature death.\n\n\""I used to suggest that sleep is the third pillar of good health, along with diet and exercise,\"" says Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. \""But I don't agree with that anymore. Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do to reset your brain and body for health.\""\nDespite the mounting evidence of its benefits, Americans are sleeping about two hours less each night than they did a century ago. Blame the technology-fueled 24/7 workplace, social media or the relentless news cycle, but about one-third of U.S. adults sleep less than the recommended seven hours daily, and 40% report feeling drowsy during the day, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The problem begins early: only 15% to 30% of U.S. teens get the 8½ hours a night recommended for adolescents.\n\nWhile life expectancy has been inching upward over the past century thanks to advances in medicine and technology, those gains could start to sag under the weight of our collective sleeplessness. Many people still dismiss sleep as something they can occasionally (or even regularly) skimp on, but the biological facts are clear: it is neither safe nor wise to take sleep lightly.\n\n\""To me, sleep is like the canary in the coal mine,\"" says David Schnyer, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Texas, Austin. \""Changes in sleep can create systemwide changes in the organism, and all of the stages of sleep affect the entire body and brain.\""\n\nThat's why sleep deprivation is so strongly linked to disease and premature death. One recent study even showed that sleep deprivation in mice can cause death faster than starvation can. And yet doctors—those who talk to their patients about sleep in the first place, anyway—report that many people still aren't convinced that their nightly rest is a critical piece of the long-life puzzle. Health obsessives who would never touch a cigarette and pride themselves on avoiding junk food may also boast about how much they get done, and how little they sleep at night.\n\n\""Because we're asleep, we don't see the benefits of it,\"" says Robert Stickgold, a well-known sleep researcher and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. \""That's the disaster and tragedy of our current world.\""\n\nIt's been that way for a long time. Benjamin Franklin famously quipped that \""there will be sleeping enough in the grave,\"" and today, sleep is still misperceived as one of the most duty-driven and unproductive parts of the day—the habit that gets in the way of life as opposed to the one most likely to extend it.\n\nPerhaps that's because until very recently, scientists couldn't even agree on the evolutionary reason why animals need to sleep in the first place. But now they know that what happens during sleep, particularly in the brain, is critical to human well-being—not to mention a long life. That's why they also know that the cost of ignoring the latest science on sleep can be dear.\n\nSpending a good third of the day oblivious to the world around you and, by extension, incapable of protecting yourself doesn't seem like a smart way for a species to stay alive. And yet every animal does it, leading scientists to accept that sleep must be nonnegotiable for some reason—and that we must need a certain amount of it to survive.\n\nFollowing a rigorous, milestone study in 2002 of more than 1 million healthy men and women by the American Cancer Society, experts suggested that the magic amount of sleep for longevity was seven hours a night. People who slept that amount were most likely to still be alive at the end of the study's six years, compared with people who got either six hours or less, or eight hours or more, of sleep each night. To this day, that's typically the amount that doctors and public-health groups recommend for the average adult, though older people can probably get away with a little less sleep than that, and younger people need more.\n\nAnother even longer study, which followed more than 21,000 twins in Finland, found that people who were regularly sleeping less than seven hours daily were 21% to 26% more likely to die of any cause during the study's 22-year period than those who slept more than eight hours.\n\nSo clearly sleep has some real biological benefit. Could it just be that the brain and body need downtime to recuperate after the activity of the day? That was the most popular explanation for decades, until an inquisitive neuroscientist at the University of Rochester decided to look for the answer inside the brain itself. When she did, Dr. Maiken Nedergaard uncovered what many scientists now agree is sleep's primary evolutionary function: to clean out the brain, quite literally, of accumulating debris.\n\nIn 2014, Nedergaard first revealed that while the body appears to rest during sleep, a whole lot is happening inside the brain. Neurons pulse with electrical signals that wash over the brain in a rhythmic flow. The brain runs checks on itself to ensure that the balance of hormones, enzymes and proteins isn't too far off-kilter. All the while, brain cells contract, opening up the spaces between them so that fluid can wash out the toxic detritus that can cause all kinds of problems if it builds up.\n\""It's like a dishwasher that keeps flushing through to wash the dirt away,\"" Nedergaard says.\n\nWithout that nightly wash cycle, dangerous toxins can damage healthy cells and interfere with their ability to communicate with one another. In the short term, that can impede memory formation and the ability to coherently compose our thoughts and regulate our emotions. Over time, the consequences can be more dire. Lack of sleep can lead to faster aging of brain cells, contributing to diseases like Alzheimer's, which is now the cause of death for 1 in 3 seniors.\n\nNedergaard's research, which was done in mice, prompted a crucial rethinking of not only the benefits of sleep but also its biological function. It turns out the brain and body are extremely active when we sleep—we're just not aware of most of what occurs while we do it.\n\n\""Sleep is not just a passive state but a fairly active state on the molecular level,\"" says Dr. Allan Pack, director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology at the University of Pennsylvania. \""During the day, the brain is using energy resources to fire neurons. At night, a switch turns on so the sleeping brain can take advantage of the metabolic downtime to do some cleaning up.\""\n\nThe idea that sleep is a time of important biological activity, rather than a period when the body checks out, is transforming how doctors think about another important factor in longevity: mental health.\n\nScientists have long known that sleep is important for memory. But it turns out that during sleep, especially the cycles of deep dream sleep, the brain doesn't just revisit the events of a day in a more organized way. It also works on processing the emotions attached to these recollections. When a memory is filed away during sleep, it's also stripped of some of the powerful feelings—like fear, grief, anger or joy—that might have clouded the experiences in the heat of the moment.\n\nIt wouldn't be healthy, or efficient, to remember every event or experience in its full factual and emotional context. But separating the emotional aspects of a memory—the anger over an argument with your spouse, the frustration at the guy who cut you off in traffic, the dejection you felt after getting a curt email reply from your boss—from its objective parts allows you to recall the experience without reliving it. \""We sleep to remember and we sleep to forget,\"" says Walker, the UC Berkeley sleep scientist, of this coping mechanism. \""I call it overnight therapy.\""\n\nThis type of processing takes time. It likely happens only during deep, quality sleep, and only over consistent nights of such sleep. That may explain why people who cut their sleep short or experience interrupted sleep may not fully disentangle the emotional baggage from their memories.\n\nIn those cases the memory, in its emotionally taxing entirety, continues to resurface every time the brain tries to sleep, in a vain effort to be properly processed. The brain tries to store the memory in a neutral way, but without deep sleep, there just isn't enough time for that triage.\n\nWalker believes these aborted efforts may drive conditions like PTSD, which is well understood to be common among combat veterans but which may be more common among the general population than therapists and researchers previously thought.\n\n\""The more nights you sleep, the more soothing the influence of sleep on that memory,\"" he says. \""Sleep continues to work on those emotional memories and flatten them out after about a week. Now there's great evidence that PTSD is a disorder in which that process fails.\""\n\nWalker saw this effect firsthand when he showed a group of people a frightening video. He kept some of the people awake after the viewing and allowed the rest to sleep normally. Those who were not allowed to sleep properly were more likely to remember the negative aspects of the video than those who got enough sleep.\n\nThere's also strong support for the idea that insufficient sleep may be a trigger for, and not just a symptom of, a number of mental illnesses, including depression, bipolar disorder and even schizophrenia. Depriving people with bipolar disorder of sleep, for example, can launch a manic episode, while some people with depression report worsening symptoms when they aren't sleeping well.\n\nFully understanding the role sleep plays in mental illness is a rich area of future research. Already many doctors think consistent, high-quality sleep can have a direct bearing on the health of those with mental illness. \""Anyone who suffers from moderate or significant mental-health concerns needs to be aware that sleep may be one of the most important things they can do,\"" says Walker.\n\nStress, scientists also know, is one of the more potent accelerators of aging, and a body that's not sleeping enough looks similar to one that's stressed out—it's highly reactive to perceived threats, even when those threats don't pose any real risk. Biologically speaking, there's virtually no difference in the way a body reacts to a startling noise in the middle of the night, a rabid raccoon or a stressful work deadline: in all cases, fight-or-flight mode is triggered, blood pressure spikes, breathing gets shallow, and the heart starts to race. That's what happens to a body on no sleep too.\n\nThose stress reactions can be useful, of course: they help you respond more readily to an actual physical threat. But that's not usually what's going on. And staying in an alert mode can trigger a number of unhealthy conditions, the most damaging of which is inflammation.\n\nInflammation is the body's natural defense system against injury or invading microbes like bacteria and viruses. It's why your toe turns red and throbs when you stub it or when it's infected: white blood cells rush to the area in order to protect it for the short time it's needed to help you get better. But inflammation can also become chronic, and that's when the real trouble starts.\n\nChronic inflammation, doctors now know, is a leading driver of many diseases, including some cancers, cognitive decline, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes—even chronic pain. And one of the main drivers of chronic inflammation is, of course, not sleeping enough.\n\nGetting a decent night's sleep, then, is good advice for all of us. Americans spent an estimated $41 billion on sleeping pills and other sleep aids in 2015; no matter how much we may boast about our stamina, we know intuitively that we need sleep, even if we don't always know why.\n\nBut scientists do. That's why experts are insisting, with increasing frequency and noise, that sleep be a priority—as important or more than what you eat and how much you exercise. We wouldn't dream of skipping meals on a regular basis, so why skimp on sleep?\n\nThere's still much about sleep that mystifies scientists—particularly about what goes wrong for so many of us, night after night. But as they chip away at the underlying causes of sleeplessness, they get ever closer to a cure. Harvard's Zielinski, for one, is hopeful that they will eventually find a way to help more people sleep better every night.When he gave his sleepless mice a drug to fix the mutation that was interfering with their sleep in the first place, they began to slumber anew.""]]"

When she did, Dr. Maiken Nedergaard uncovered what many scientists now agree is sleep's primary evolutionary function: to clean out the brain, quite literally, of accumulating debris.\n\nIn 2014, Nedergaard first revealed that while the body appears to rest during sleep, a whole lot is happening inside the brain. Neurons pulse with electrical signals that wash over the brain in a rhythmic flow. The brain runs checks on itself to ensure that the balance of hormones, enzymes and proteins isn't too far off-kilter. All the while, brain cells contract, opening up the spaces between them so that fluid can wash out the toxic detritus that can cause all kinds of problems if it builds up.\n\""It's like a dishwasher that keeps flushing through to wash the dirt away,\"" Nedergaard says.\n\nWithout that nightly wash cycle, dangerous toxins can damage healthy cells and interfere with their ability to communicate with one another. In the short term, that can impede memory formation and the ability to coherently compose our thoughts and regulate our emotions. Over time, the consequences can be more dire. Lack of sleep can lead to faster aging of brain cells, contributing to diseases like Alzheimer's, which is now the cause of death for 1 in 3 seniors.\n\nNedergaard's research, which was done in mice, prompted a crucial rethinking of not only the benefits of sleep but also its biological function. It turns out the brain and body are extremely active when we sleep—we're just not aware of most of what occurs while we do it.\n\n\""Sleep is not just a passive state but a fairly active state on the molecular level,\"" says Dr. Allan Pack, director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology at the University of Pennsylvania. \""During the day, the brain is using energy resources to fire neurons. At night, a switch turns on so the sleeping brain can take advantage of the metabolic downtime to do some cleaning up.\""\n\nThe idea that sleep is a time of important biological activity, rather than a period when the body checks out, is transforming how doctors think about another important factor in longevity: mental health.\n\nScientists have long known that sleep is important for memory. But it turns out that during sleep, especially the cycles of deep dream sleep, the brain doesn't just revisit the events of a day in a more organized way. It also works on processing the emotions attached to these recollections. When a memory is filed away during sleep, it's also stripped of some of the powerful feelings—like fear, grief, anger or joy—that might have clouded the experiences in the heat of the moment.\n\nIt wouldn't be healthy, or efficient, to remember every event or experience in its full factual and emotional context. But separating the emotional aspects of a memory—the anger over an argument with your spouse, the frustration at the guy who cut you off in traffic, the dejection you felt after getting a curt email reply from your boss—from its objective parts allows you to recall the experience without reliving it. \""We sleep to remember and we sleep to forget,\"" says Walker, the UC Berkeley sleep scientist, of this coping mechanism. \""I call it overnight therapy.\""\n\nThis type of processing takes time. It likely happens only during deep, quality sleep, and only over consistent nights of such sleep. That may explain why people who cut their sleep short or experience interrupted sleep may not fully disentangle the emotional baggage from their memories.\n\nIn those cases the memory, in its emotionally taxing entirety, continues to resurface every time the brain tries to sleep, in a vain effort to be properly processed. The brain tries to store the memory in a neutral way, but without deep sleep, there just isn't enough time for that triage.\n\nWalker believes these aborted efforts may drive conditions like PTSD, which is well understood to be common among combat veterans but which may be more common among the general population than therapists and researchers previously thought.\n\n\""The more nights you sleep, the more soothing the influence of sleep on that memory,\"" he says. \""Sleep continues to work on those emotional memories and flatten them out after about a week. Now there's great evidence that PTSD is a disorder in which that process fails.\""\n\nWalker saw this effect firsthand when he showed a group of people a frightening video. He kept some of the people awake after the viewing and allowed the rest to sleep normally. Those who were not allowed to sleep properly were more likely to remember the negative aspects of the video than those who got enough sleep.\n\nThere's also strong support for the idea that insufficient sleep may be a trigger for, and not just a symptom of, a number of mental illnesses, including depression, bipolar disorder and even schizophrenia. Depriving people with bipolar disorder of sleep, for example, can launch a manic episode, while some people with depression report worsening symptoms when they aren't sleeping well.\n\nFully understanding the role sleep plays in mental illness is a rich area of future research. Already many doctors think consistent, high-quality sleep can have a direct bearing on the health of those with mental illness. \""Anyone who suffers from moderate or significant mental-health concerns needs to be aware that sleep may be one of the most important things they can do,\"" says Walker.\n\nStress, scientists also know, is one of the more potent accelerators of aging, and a body that's not sleeping enough looks similar to one that's stressed out—it's highly reactive to perceived threats, even when those threats don't pose any real risk. Biologically speaking, there's virtually no difference in the way a body reacts to a startling noise in the middle of the night, a rabid raccoon or a stressful work deadline: in all cases, fight-or-flight mode is triggered, blood pressure spikes, breathing gets shallow, and the heart starts to race. That's what happens to a body on no sleep too.\n\nThose stress reactions can be useful, of course: they help you respond more readily to an actual physical threat. But that's not usually what's going on. And staying in an alert mode can trigger a number of unhealthy conditions, the most damaging of which is inflammation.\n\nInflammation is the body's natural defense system against injury or invading microbes like bacteria and viruses. It's why your toe turns red and throbs when you stub it or when it's infected: white blood cells rush to the area in order to protect it for the short time it's needed to help you get better. But inflammation can also become chronic, and that's when the real trouble starts.\n\nChronic inflammation, doctors now know, is a leading driver of many diseases, including some cancers, cognitive decline, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes—even chronic pain. And one of the main drivers of chronic inflammation is, of course, not sleeping enough.\n\nGetting a decent night's sleep, then, is good advice for all of us. Americans spent an estimated $41 billion on sleeping pills and other sleep aids in 2015; no matter how much we may boast about our stamina, we know intuitively that we need sleep, even if we don't always know why.\n\nBut scientists do. That's why experts are insisting, with increasing frequency and noise, that sleep be a priority—as important or more than what you eat and how much you exercise. We wouldn't dream of skipping meals on a regular basis, so why skimp on sleep?\n\nThere's still much about sleep that mystifies scientists—particularly about what goes wrong for so many of us, night after night. But as they chip away at the underlying causes of sleeplessness, they get ever closer to a cure. Harvard's Zielinski, for one, is hopeful that they will eventually find a way to help more people sleep better every night.When he gave his sleepless mice a drug to fix the mutation that was interfering with their sleep in the first place, they began to slumber anew.""]]"

Normally, the animals woke and slept on a 12-hour cycle. When the lights were on in the lab, the mice were active. When it went dark on a timer, down they went. But Zielinski, who teaches psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, had recently tweaked their schedule to keep the mice up past their bedtime.\n\nZielinski and his colleagues would rustle the bedding in the mice's cages to keep them from dozing off when they started to display the telltale signs of sleepiness—drooping lids, sluggish walk, EEG readings showing their brain activity was waning. But Zielinski noticed that when the mice were left alone to slumber at will after the disruption, they didn't, or perhaps couldn't, fall asleep.\n\nThat the sleep-deprived rodents slept less than they normally would didn't really surprise Zielinski. The mice had a genetic mutation that he suspected was linked to sleep problems. More striking were the electrical brain readings showing that even when they did sleep, they weren't getting the deep, restorative kind of rest that doctors say matters most—not just to rodents but also to humans.\n\nIn the right conditions, researchers believe, the brain produces a signal that essentially tells the body's major systems—the heart, the lungs, the digestive system, the nervous system, even the muscles—that it's time to call it quits for the day. Zielinski's research has found that, just as with the mice with the mutation, it's likely that in some people with chronic sleep problems, that critical signal isn't firing.\n\nUnderstanding what's behind some forms of insomnia, an aim of Zielinski's research, is a major step in learning how to fix it. That's a big deal in sleep research, because evidence linking quality rest to good health and longevity has never been more convincing.\n\nScientists are learning that shortchanging sleep can compromise nearly every major body system, from the brain to the heart to the immune system, making our inability—or unwillingness—to sleep enough one of the unhealthiest things we can do.\nStudies of people whose sleep sessions are irregular or short show they are at higher risk of developing diseases that can lead to early death, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. Poor sleep may have detrimental effects on the brain as well, increasing the risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, as well as mood disorders like depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. And like smoking, a terrible diet and not exercising enough, poor sleep is now linked to an overall increased risk of premature death.\n\n\""I used to suggest that sleep is the third pillar of good health, along with diet and exercise,\"" says Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. \""But I don't agree with that anymore. Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do to reset your brain and body for health.\""\nDespite the mounting evidence of its benefits, Americans are sleeping about two hours less each night than they did a century ago. Blame the technology-fueled 24/7 workplace, social media or the relentless news cycle, but about one-third of U.S. adults sleep less than the recommended seven hours daily, and 40% report feeling drowsy during the day, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The problem begins early: only 15% to 30% of U.S. teens get the 8½ hours a night recommended for adolescents.\n\nWhile life expectancy has been inching upward over the past century thanks to advances in medicine and technology, those gains could start to sag under the weight of our collective sleeplessness. Many people still dismiss sleep as something they can occasionally (or even regularly) skimp on, but the biological facts are clear: it is neither safe nor wise to take sleep lightly.\n\n\""To me, sleep is like the canary in the coal mine,\"" says David Schnyer, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Texas, Austin. \""Changes in sleep can create systemwide changes in the organism, and all of the stages of sleep affect the entire body and brain.\""\n\nThat's why sleep deprivation is so strongly linked to disease and premature death. One recent study even showed that sleep deprivation in mice can cause death faster than starvation can. And yet doctors—those who talk to their patients about sleep in the first place, anyway—report that many people still aren't convinced that their nightly rest is a critical piece of the long-life puzzle. Health obsessives who would never touch a cigarette and pride themselves on avoiding junk food may also boast about how much they get done, and how little they sleep at night.\n\n\""Because we're asleep, we don't see the benefits of it,\"" says Robert Stickgold, a well-known sleep researcher and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. \""That's the disaster and tragedy of our current world.\""\n\nIt's been that way for a long time. Benjamin Franklin famously quipped that \""there will be sleeping enough in the grave,\"" and today, sleep is still misperceived as one of the most duty-driven and unproductive parts of the day—the habit that gets in the way of life as opposed to the one most likely to extend it.\n\nPerhaps that's because until very recently, scientists couldn't even agree on the evolutionary reason why animals need to sleep in the first place. But now they know that what happens during sleep, particularly in the brain, is critical to human well-being—not to mention a long life. That's why they also know that the cost of ignoring the latest science on sleep can be dear.\n\nSpending a good third of the day oblivious to the world around you and, by extension, incapable of protecting yourself doesn't seem like a smart way for a species to stay alive. And yet every animal does it, leading scientists to accept that sleep must be nonnegotiable for some reason—and that we must need a certain amount of it to survive.\n\nFollowing a rigorous, milestone study in 2002 of more than 1 million healthy men and women by the American Cancer Society, experts suggested that the magic amount of sleep for longevity was seven hours a night. People who slept that amount were most likely to still be alive at the end of the study's six years, compared with people who got either six hours or less, or eight hours or more, of sleep each night. To this day, that's typically the amount that doctors and public-health groups recommend for the average adult, though older people can probably get away with a little less sleep than that, and younger people need more.\n\nAnother even longer study, which followed more than 21,000 twins in Finland, found that people who were regularly sleeping less than seven hours daily were 21% to 26% more likely to die of any cause during the study's 22-year period than those who slept more than eight hours.\n\nSo clearly sleep has some real biological benefit. Could it just be that the brain and body need downtime to recuperate after the activity of the day? That was the most popular explanation for decades, until an inquisitive neuroscientist at the University of Rochester decided to look for the answer inside the brain itself.

Health obsessives who would never touch a cigarette and pride themselves on avoiding junk food may also boast about how much they get done, and how little they sleep at night.\n\n\""Because we're asleep, we don't see the benefits of it,\"" says Robert Stickgold, a well-known sleep researcher and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. \""That's the disaster and tragedy of our current world.\""\n\nIt's been that way for a long time. Benjamin Franklin famously quipped that \""there will be sleeping enough in the grave,\"" and today, sleep is still misperceived as one of the most duty-driven and unproductive parts of the day—the habit that gets in the way of life as opposed to the one most likely to extend it.\n\nPerhaps that's because until very recently, scientists couldn't even agree on the evolutionary reason why animals need to sleep in the first place. But now they know that what happens during sleep, particularly in the brain, is critical to human well-being—not to mention a long life. That's why they also know that the cost of ignoring the latest science on sleep can be dear.\n\nSpending a good third of the day oblivious to the world around you and, by extension, incapable of protecting yourself doesn't seem like a smart way for a species to stay alive. And yet every animal does it, leading scientists to accept that sleep must be nonnegotiable for some reason—and that we must need a certain amount of it to survive.\n\nFollowing a rigorous, milestone study in 2002 of more than 1 million healthy men and women by the American Cancer Society, experts suggested that the magic amount of sleep for longevity was seven hours a night. People who slept that amount were most likely to still be alive at the end of the study's six years, compared with people who got either six hours or less, or eight hours or more, of sleep each night. To this day, that's typically the amount that doctors and public-health groups recommend for the average adult, though older people can probably get away with a little less sleep than that, and younger people need more.\n\nAnother even longer study, which followed more than 21,000 twins in Finland, found that people who were regularly sleeping less than seven hours daily were 21% to 26% more likely to die of any cause during the study's 22-year period than those who slept more than eight hours.\n\nSo clearly sleep has some real biological benefit. Could it just be that the brain and body need downtime to recuperate after the activity of the day? That was the most popular explanation for decades, until an inquisitive neuroscientist at the University of Rochester decided to look for the answer inside the brain itself. When she did, Dr. Maiken Nedergaard uncovered what many scientists now agree is sleep's primary evolutionary function: to clean out the brain, quite literally, of accumulating debris.\n\nIn 2014, Nedergaard first revealed that while the body appears to rest during sleep, a whole lot is happening inside the brain. Neurons pulse with electrical signals that wash over the brain in a rhythmic flow. The brain runs checks on itself to ensure that the balance of hormones, enzymes and proteins isn't too far off-kilter. All the while, brain cells contract, opening up the spaces between them so that fluid can wash out the toxic detritus that can cause all kinds of problems if it builds up.\n\""It's like a dishwasher that keeps flushing through to wash the dirt away,\"" Nedergaard says.\n\nWithout that nightly wash cycle, dangerous toxins can damage healthy cells and interfere with their ability to communicate with one another. In the short term, that can impede memory formation and the ability to coherently compose our thoughts and regulate our emotions. Over time, the consequences can be more dire. Lack of sleep can lead to faster aging of brain cells, contributing to diseases like Alzheimer's, which is now the cause of death for 1 in 3 seniors.\n\nNedergaard's research, which was done in mice, prompted a crucial rethinking of not only the benefits of sleep but also its biological function. It turns out the brain and body are extremely active when we sleep—we're just not aware of most of what occurs while we do it.\n\n\""Sleep is not just a passive state but a fairly active state on the molecular level,\"" says Dr. Allan Pack, director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology at the University of Pennsylvania. \""During the day, the brain is using energy resources to fire neurons. At night, a switch turns on so the sleeping brain can take advantage of the metabolic downtime to do some cleaning up.\""\n\nThe idea that sleep is a time of important biological activity, rather than a period when the body checks out, is transforming how doctors think about another important factor in longevity: mental health.\n\nScientists have long known that sleep is important for memory. But it turns out that during sleep, especially the cycles of deep dream sleep, the brain doesn't just revisit the events of a day in a more organized way. It also works on processing the emotions attached to these recollections. When a memory is filed away during sleep, it's also stripped of some of the powerful feelings—like fear, grief, anger or joy—that might have clouded the experiences in the heat of the moment.\n\nIt wouldn't be healthy, or efficient, to remember every event or experience in its full factual and emotional context. But separating the emotional aspects of a memory—the anger over an argument with your spouse, the frustration at the guy who cut you off in traffic, the dejection you felt after getting a curt email reply from your boss—from its objective parts allows you to recall the experience without reliving it. \""We sleep to remember and we sleep to forget,\"" says Walker, the UC Berkeley sleep scientist, of this coping mechanism. \""I call it overnight therapy.\""\n\nThis type of processing takes time. It likely happens only during deep, quality sleep, and only over consistent nights of such sleep. That may explain why people who cut their sleep short or experience interrupted sleep may not fully disentangle the emotional baggage from their memories.\n\nIn those cases the memory, in its emotionally taxing entirety, continues to resurface every time the brain tries to sleep, in a vain effort to be properly processed. The brain tries to store the memory in a neutral way, but without deep sleep, there just isn't enough time for that triage.\n\nWalker believes these aborted efforts may drive conditions like PTSD, which is well understood to be common among combat veterans but which may be more common among the general population than therapists and researchers previously thought.\n\n\""The more nights you sleep, the more soothing the influence of sleep on that memory,\"" he says. \""Sleep continues to work on those emotional memories and flatten them out after about a week. Now there's great evidence that PTSD is a disorder in which that process fails.\""\n\nWalker saw this effect firsthand when he showed a group of people a frightening video. He kept some of the people awake after the viewing and allowed the rest to sleep normally. Those who were not allowed to sleep properly were more likely to remember the negative aspects of the video than those who got enough sleep.\n\nThere's also strong support for the idea that insufficient sleep may be a trigger for, and not just a symptom of, a number of mental illnesses, including depression, bipolar disorder and even schizophrenia. Depriving people with bipolar disorder of sleep, for example, can launch a manic episode, while some people with depression report worsening symptoms when they aren't sleeping well.\n\nFully understanding the role sleep plays in mental illness is a rich area of future research. Already many doctors think consistent, high-quality sleep can have a direct bearing on the health of those with mental illness. \""Anyone who suffers from moderate or significant mental-health concerns needs to be aware that sleep may be one of the most important things they can do,\"" says Walker.\n\nStress, scientists also know, is one of the more potent accelerators of aging, and a body that's not sleeping enough looks similar to one that's stressed out—it's highly reactive to perceived threats, even when those threats don't pose any real risk. Biologically speaking, there's virtually no difference in the way a body reacts to a startling noise in the middle of the night, a rabid raccoon or a stressful work deadline: in all cases, fight-or-flight mode is triggered, blood pressure spikes, breathing gets shallow, and the heart starts to race. That's what happens to a body on no sleep too.\n\nThose stress reactions can be useful, of course: they help you respond more readily to an actual physical threat. But that's not usually what's going on. And staying in an alert mode can trigger a number of unhealthy conditions, the most damaging of which is inflammation.\n\nInflammation is the body's natural defense system against injury or invading microbes like bacteria and viruses. It's why your toe turns red and throbs when you stub it or when it's infected: white blood cells rush to the area in order to protect it for the short time it's needed to help you get better. But inflammation can also become chronic, and that's when the real trouble starts.\n\nChronic inflammation, doctors now know, is a leading driver of many diseases, including some cancers, cognitive decline, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes—even chronic pain. And one of the main drivers of chronic inflammation is, of course, not sleeping enough.\n\nGetting a decent night's sleep, then, is good advice for all of us. Americans spent an estimated $41 billion on sleeping pills and other sleep aids in 2015; no matter how much we may boast about our stamina, we know intuitively that we need sleep, even if we don't always know why.\n\nBut scientists do. That's why experts are insisting, with increasing frequency and noise, that sleep be a priority—as important or more than what you eat and how much you exercise. We wouldn't dream of skipping meals on a regular basis, so why skimp on sleep?\n\nThere's still much about sleep that mystifies scientists—particularly about what goes wrong for so many of us, night after night. But as they chip away at the underlying causes of sleeplessness, they get ever closer to a cure. Harvard's Zielinski, for one, is hopeful that they will eventually find a way to help more people sleep better every night.When he gave his sleepless mice a drug to fix the mutation that was interfering with their sleep in the first place, they began to slumber anew.""]]"

Changes like muscle degradation can be offset by exercise regimens, but new research suggests that microgravity can affect the human brain in ways that science is still struggling to grasp. A research team led by Rachael Seidler, a professor at the University of Michigan, took MRI scans of over twenty astronauts before and after spaceflights of various lengths, and some of the changes observed are shocking.\n\nA total of 26 astronauts were scanned before and after their stays in space; 12 who were shuttle crew members spending two weeks in space, and 14 who resided on the International Space Station for six months at a time. After comparing the scans, the scientists discovered that every single one of them saw noticeable changes in the amount and gray matter on various sections of their brains.\n\n[Image of average change across 18 subjects, from four angles of the brain with changes marked in orange.  Image of average change across 27 subjects, from four angles of the brain with changes marked in orange.]\n\n“We found large regions of gray matter volume decreases, which could be related to redistribution of cerebrospinal fluid in space,” Seidler explained in a post detailing the study. “Gravity is not available to pull fluids down in the body, resulting in so-called puffy face in space. This may result in a shift of brain position or compression.”\n\nIn short, the lack of gravity actually changed the physical shape of the astronauts’ brains, but there’s more. The scans showed that areas that saw increases in gray matter were the sections that process movement information, and more specifically the movement of a person’s legs. The team believes that may be related to the brain working harder to learn new ways of moving related to the lack of gravity. The scans also showed that the changes were more dramatic in the astronauts who spent months aboard the ISS as opposed to those who only had brief trips aboard the shuttle.\n\nThe next step for the team is to determine how long the brain changes actually last, and whether trips into space have permanent or extremely long-lasting affects.""]]"

What makes the findings especially disturbing, said experts not involved in the research, is that when screening guidelines and follow-up monitoring are pursued, cervical cancer is largely preventable.\n\n“This shows that our disparities are even worse than we feared,” said Dr. Kathleen M. Schmeler, an associate professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. “We have screenings that are great, but many women in America are not getting them. And now I have even more concerns going forward, with the” — expected — “repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which covers screening, and the closing of family planning clinics, which do much of that screening.”\n\nThe racial disparity had been noted in earlier studies, but it had been thought to have narrowed because cervical cancer death rates for black women were declining. But this study said that the gap was far greater than believed.\n\nIn the new analysis, the mortality rate for black women was 10.1 per 100,000. For white women, it is 4.7 per 100,000.\n\nPrevious studies had put those figures at 5.7 and 3.2.\n\nThe new rates do not reflect a rise in the number of deaths, which recent estimates put at more than 4,000 a year in the United States. Instead, the figures come from a re-examination of existing numbers, in an adjusted context.\n\nTypically, death rates for cervical cancer are calculated by assessing the number of women who die from a disease against the general population at risk for it. But these epidemiologists, who looked at health data from 2000 to 2012, also excluded women who had had hysterectomies from that larger population. A hysterectomy almost always removes the cervix, and thus the possibility that a woman will develop cervical cancer.\n\n“We don’t include men in our calculation because they are not at risk for cervical cancer and by the same measure, we shouldn’t include women who don’t have a cervix,” said Anne F. Rositch, the lead author and an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “If we want to look at how well our programs are doing, we have to look at the women we’re targeting.”\n\nAlthough the study did not explore reasons for the racial disparity, some doctors said it could reflect unequal access to screening, ability to pursue early-warning test results, and insurance coverage. A recent study in the journal Gynecologic Oncology that looked at 15,194 patients with advanced cervical cancer found that more than half did not receive treatment considered to be standard of care, and that those patients were more likely to be black and poor.\n\nAccording to the analysis published Monday, the hysterectomy-corrected mortality rates put black American women on par with women living in some underdeveloped countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n[Photo]\n\nDr. M. Margaret Kemeny, director of the Queens Cancer Center of Queens Hospital, treats many younger women of color who have a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Credit Joshua Bright for The New York Times\nCertainly removing women who had hysterectomies from the data pool had a significant effect. About 20 percent of women in the United States have a hysterectomy, often for problems unrelated to cancer, like excessive bleeding and fibroids, with prevalence higher among black women than white.\n\nIn years to come, mortality and incidence rates should decline as more women receive HPV vaccines, which prevents many cervical cancers.\n\nIn recent years, with recognition of the slow progression of the disease, the success of the vaccine and more sophisticated screening tests, guidelines for cervical cancer assessments have shifted. Depending on circumstances, some women need to be screened only every five years.\n\nThe guidelines suggest that screening end at age 65 for women who have had two or three consecutive negative results in the previous decade.\n\nThe current study says that the greatest mortality rates hit black women 85 and older.\n\nBut experts said the new findings did not necessarily point to the need to revisit the upper end of the guidelines. Cervical cancer progresses so slowly, with so many early-warning stages, experts said, that it is highly unlikely that a 65-year-old woman who had met guidelines’ requirements would subsequently develop the disease.\n\nBut given the rigor of the guidelines and screenings, Dr. Rositch said, why do American women not only still get cervical cancer but die from it? And with such pronounced racial and age divides?\n\nDr. Otis W. Brawley, the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said that the new study pointed to inequity of access and good treatment.\n\n“When we look at the difference between black and white, and rich and poor, we find the same disparity,” he said. “The quality of assessment and follow-up treatment can be different. The question becomes: how do we get adequate preventive care to all people?”\n\nAlthough this study looked at the divide between black and white women, Dr. Schmeler said that it implicitly raised alarms for other poor women of color. Along border towns in Texas, with an overwhelmingly poor, Hispanic population, she said that rates of incidence and death from cervical cancer were considerably higher than national figures.\n\nStudies such as this latest one consider death rates from a broad epidemiological perspective; statistically, its grimmest news is about older black women. But on the ground, Dr. M. Margaret Kemeny, the director of the Queens Cancer Center of Queens Hospital, a public institution in New York, said she had treated many younger women of color with a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Although the disease is preventable and, if detected early, treatable, Dr. Kemeny’s patients have often never had Pap smears.\n\nShe recently had to perform total pelvic exenterations on two women, each with recurring cervical cancer, one Chinese, the other Hispanic. She removed the cervix, vagina, rectum and bladder, inserting two ostomy bags, which are worn outside the body to collect urine and stool. “One was 39,” Dr. Kemeny said, “and the other was 25.”""]]"

Credit Jennifer Sens for The New York Times\nDuring her pregnancy, she never drank alcohol or had a cigarette. But nearly every day, Stacey, then 24, smoked marijuana.\n\nWith her fiancé’s blessing, she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell morning sickness before going to work at a sandwich shop. When sciatica made it unbearable to stand during her 12-hour shifts, she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break.\n\n“I wouldn’t necessarily say, ‘Go smoke a pound of pot when you’re pregnant,’” said Stacey, now a stay-at-home mother in Deltona, Fla., who asked that her full name be withheld because street-bought marijuana is illegal in Florida. “In moderation, it’s O.K.”\n\nMany pregnant women, particularly younger ones, seem to agree, a recent federal survey shows. As states legalize marijuana or its medical use, expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers — another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health.\n\nA Balm When You’re Expecting: Sometimes Pot Does the Trick FEB. 20, 2017\n\nPET CITY\nDogs on Marijuana: Not Cool FEB. 2, 2017\n\nPets on Pot: The Newest Customer Base for Medical Marijuana OCT. 8, 2016\n\nCalifornians Legalize Marijuana in Vote That Could Echo Nationally NOV. 9, 2016\n\nD.E.A. Keeps Marijuana on List of Dangerous Drugs, Frustrating Advocates AUG. 11, 2016\nAdvertisement\n\nOften pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants. But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana’s main psychoactive ingredient — tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC — can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk.\n\n“There is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it’s actually safe,” said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use.\n\nIn the federal survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of mothers-to-be said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2.4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.)\n\n[Photo]\n\nStacey’s son just had his first birthday. He’s walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn’t worried about his development. Credit Jennifer Sens for The New York Times\nYoung mothers-to-be were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7.5 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44.\n\nEvidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, 6-year-olds born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention.\n\nMost troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers.\n\n“Prenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,” said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nSeveral studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use.

Credit Jennifer Sens for The New York Times\nDuring her pregnancy, she never drank alcohol or had a cigarette. But nearly every day, Stacey, then 24, smoked marijuana.\n\nWith her fiancé’s blessing, she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell morning sickness before going to work at a sandwich shop. When sciatica made it unbearable to stand during her 12-hour shifts, she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break.\n\n“I wouldn’t necessarily say, ‘Go smoke a pound of pot when you’re pregnant,’” said Stacey, now a stay-at-home mother in Deltona, Fla., who asked that her full name be withheld because street-bought marijuana is illegal in Florida. “In moderation, it’s O.K.”\n\nMany pregnant women, particularly younger ones, seem to agree, a recent federal survey shows. As states legalize marijuana or its medical use, expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers — another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health.\n\nA Balm When You’re Expecting: Sometimes Pot Does the Trick FEB. 20, 2017\n\nPET CITY\nDogs on Marijuana: Not Cool FEB. 2, 2017\n\nPets on Pot: The Newest Customer Base for Medical Marijuana OCT. 8, 2016\n\nCalifornians Legalize Marijuana in Vote That Could Echo Nationally NOV. 9, 2016\n\nD.E.A.

But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana’s main psychoactive ingredient — tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC — can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk.\n\n“There is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it’s actually safe,” said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use.\n\nIn the federal survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of mothers-to-be said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2.4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.)\n\n[Photo]\n\nStacey’s son just had his first birthday. He’s walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn’t worried about his development. Credit Jennifer Sens for The New York Times\nYoung mothers-to-be were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7.5 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44.\n\nEvidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, 6-year-olds born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention.\n\nMost troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers.\n\n“Prenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,” said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nSeveral studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion.\n\n“Even early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,” said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. “Those are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition.”\n\nIt is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even eventually reducing I.Q.\n\n“The effects are not dramatic, but that doesn’t mean they are not important,” said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. “It could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B.”\n\n“You could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,” she added.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement.

As states legalize marijuana or its medical use, expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers — another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health.\n\nA Balm When You’re Expecting: Sometimes Pot Does the Trick FEB. 20, 2017\n\nPET CITY\nDogs on Marijuana: Not Cool FEB. 2, 2017\n\nPets on Pot: The Newest Customer Base for Medical Marijuana OCT. 8, 2016\n\nCalifornians Legalize Marijuana in Vote That Could Echo Nationally NOV. 9, 2016\n\nD.E.A. Keeps Marijuana on List of Dangerous Drugs, Frustrating Advocates AUG. 11, 2016\nAdvertisement\n\nOften pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants. But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana’s main psychoactive ingredient — tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC — can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk.\n\n“There is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it’s actually safe,” said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use.\n\nIn the federal survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of mothers-to-be said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2.4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.)\n\n[Photo]\n\nStacey’s son just had his first birthday. He’s walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn’t worried about his development. Credit Jennifer Sens for The New York Times\nYoung mothers-to-be were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7.5 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44.\n\nEvidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, 6-year-olds born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention.\n\nMost troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers.\n\n“Prenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,” said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nSeveral studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion.\n\n“Even early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,” said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. “Those are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition.”\n\nIt is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even eventually reducing I.Q.\n\n“The effects are not dramatic, but that doesn’t mean they are not important,” said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. “It could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B.”\n\n“You could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,” she added.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement. But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic.\n\nOf five federal agencies, only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February, according to a study published online in December in the journal Substance Abuse. Only 10 state health departments did.\n\nUntil recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered nothing.\n\n“I don’t think public health officials should be alarming people,” said Marian Jarlenski, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. “They just have to say, ‘There have been studies done, and there is some risk.’”\n\nGet the best of Well, with the latest on health, fitness and nutrition, delivered to your inbox every week.\n\nYou agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.\n\nSEE SAMPLE PRIVACY POLICY OPT OUT OR CONTACT US ANYTIME\nIn a statement, C.D.C. officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to THC in utero.\n\n“While current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent, some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy, such as low birth weight or preterm birth,” the agency said.\n\nDr. Marie McCormick, a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new report on cannabis from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, said smoking cannabis “does confer, in terms of birth weight, the same risk as cigarettes.”\n\nSome of the gathering evidence is reassuring. So far, prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious birth defects. “That’s why some providers and lay people alike think there’s no effect,” said Dr. Erica Wymore, a neonatologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado. But she warned, “Just because they don’t have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn’t mean the baby’s neurological development is not impacted.”\n\nMost research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent. Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n“All those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren’t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,” said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington’s fetal alcohol and drug unit. “We need to do a whole lot more research now.”\n\nThere are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use. Research is often based on reports by pregnant women — instead of, say, tests of urine or the umbilical cord — and they consistently underreport their use. (Researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies.) And pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol; it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself.\n\nFew realize that THC is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother’s body for weeks, if not months. It’s not known whether the fetus’s exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit.\n\nTo find out whether that’s happening, Dr. Judy Chang, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients.\n\nMedical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana, the researchers found, than to advise them of potential risks. When mothers-to-be admitted to marijuana use, almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all.\n\nPregnant women aren’t eager to discuss it, either, because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture.\n\nDepression, anxiety, stress, pain, nausea and vomiting were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 survey of low-income mothers getting federal nutrition help in Colorado. Roughly 6 percent were pot users; a third were pregnant.\n\n“Women are thinking of this as medical marijuana in that they are treating some condition,” said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute who researches substance abuse in pregnancy.\n\n“If you’re going to consider it like medicine,” she said, “then treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it.”\n\nStacey’s son just had his first birthday. He’s walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn’t worried about his development.\n\nShe still smokes pot — indeed, her son plays on a rug emblazoned with a marijuana leaf. But the severe cramps that plagued her before pregnancy are easing now.\n\n“I don’t have to smoke as much anymore,” she said.""]]"

As states legalize marijuana or its medical use, expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers — another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health.\n\nA Balm When You’re Expecting: Sometimes Pot Does the Trick FEB. 20, 2017\n\nPET CITY\nDogs on Marijuana: Not Cool FEB. 2, 2017\n\nPets on Pot: The Newest Customer Base for Medical Marijuana OCT. 8, 2016\n\nCalifornians Legalize Marijuana in Vote That Could Echo Nationally NOV. 9, 2016\n\nD.E.A. Keeps Marijuana on List of Dangerous Drugs, Frustrating Advocates AUG. 11, 2016\nAdvertisement\n\nOften pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants. But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana’s main psychoactive ingredient — tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC — can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk.\n\n“There is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it’s actually safe,” said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use.\n\nIn the federal survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of mothers-to-be said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2.4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.)\n\n[Photo]\n\nStacey’s son just had his first birthday. He’s walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn’t worried about his development. Credit Jennifer Sens for The New York Times\nYoung mothers-to-be were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7.5 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44.\n\nEvidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, 6-year-olds born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention.\n\nMost troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers.\n\n“Prenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,” said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nSeveral studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion.\n\n“Even early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,” said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. “Those are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition.”\n\nIt is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even eventually reducing I.Q.\n\n“The effects are not dramatic, but that doesn’t mean they are not important,” said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. “It could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B.”\n\n“You could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,” she added.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement. But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic.\n\nOf five federal agencies, only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February, according to a study published online in December in the journal Substance Abuse. Only 10 state health departments did.\n\nUntil recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered nothing.\n\n“I don’t think public health officials should be alarming people,” said Marian Jarlenski, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. “They just have to say, ‘There have been studies done, and there is some risk.’”\n\nGet the best of Well, with the latest on health, fitness and nutrition, delivered to your inbox every week.\n\nYou agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.\n\nSEE SAMPLE PRIVACY POLICY OPT OUT OR CONTACT US ANYTIME\nIn a statement, C.D.C. officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to THC in utero.\n\n“While current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent, some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy, such as low birth weight or preterm birth,” the agency said.\n\nDr. Marie McCormick, a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new report on cannabis from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, said smoking cannabis “does confer, in terms of birth weight, the same risk as cigarettes.”\n\nSome of the gathering evidence is reassuring. So far, prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious birth defects. “That’s why some providers and lay people alike think there’s no effect,” said Dr. Erica Wymore, a neonatologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado. But she warned, “Just because they don’t have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn’t mean the baby’s neurological development is not impacted.”\n\nMost research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent. Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n“All those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren’t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,” said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington’s fetal alcohol and drug unit. “We need to do a whole lot more research now.”\n\nThere are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use. Research is often based on reports by pregnant women — instead of, say, tests of urine or the umbilical cord — and they consistently underreport their use. (Researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies.) And pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol; it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself.\n\nFew realize that THC is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother’s body for weeks, if not months. It’s not known whether the fetus’s exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit.\n\nTo find out whether that’s happening, Dr. Judy Chang, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients.\n\nMedical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana, the researchers found, than to advise them of potential risks. When mothers-to-be admitted to marijuana use, almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all.\n\nPregnant women aren’t eager to discuss it, either, because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture.\n\nDepression, anxiety, stress, pain, nausea and vomiting were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 survey of low-income mothers getting federal nutrition help in Colorado. Roughly 6 percent were pot users; a third were pregnant.\n\n“Women are thinking of this as medical marijuana in that they are treating some condition,” said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute who researches substance abuse in pregnancy.\n\n“If you’re going to consider it like medicine,” she said, “then treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it.”\n\nStacey’s son just had his first birthday. He’s walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn’t worried about his development.\n\nShe still smokes pot — indeed, her son plays on a rug emblazoned with a marijuana leaf. But the severe cramps that plagued her before pregnancy are easing now.\n\n“I don’t have to smoke as much anymore,” she said.""]]"

Share of corner 3-pointers contested by a team’s defense vs. star made by their opponent, 2016-17 season so far, showing Spurs are an outlier]\n\nUnlike when the Spurs played in the cavernous Alamodome, where players complained about struggling with depth perception, there isn’t a clear explanation as to how the Spurs defend corner 3’s so much better than other teams without actually defending them.\n\nBut while the numbers may represent an aberration — there’s an intelligent argument to be made that 3-point defense is somewhat random — a couple of things could explain how San Antonio has avoided getting burned from the corners. Last season, for example, the Spurs played in a division where the majority of the teams were among the NBA’s worst at connecting on corner 3-point tries. That meant they got to play against Memphis (worst), New Orleans (third-worst) and Houston (ninth-worst) four times each, whereas the majority of clubs wouldn’t have had that same opportunity. (Still, that wouldn’t explain this season, given that the Rockets, Pelicans and Mavericks are all hitting corner 3s at about league-average rates, while the Grizzlies rank third best in the NBA in the category so far.)\n\nBeyond that, there’s also the fact that San Antonio’s players are tied for the league lead in terms of how fast they move on defense, according to SportVU’s tracking, perhaps forcing opposing players to pull the trigger a split-second sooner than they otherwise would. Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green, the team’s two best wing defenders, have been impactful when contesting shots, holding shooters to a combined 5-of-24 this season when closing out on corner three-point shooters.\n\n""]]"

It turns out they might literally be wired differently.\nBy DANIEL Z. LIEBERMAN and MICHAEL E. LONG \nNovember 04, 2018\nWe all know liberals and conservatives are different, broadly speaking. They disagree about immigration, global warming and health care. They consume different brands. The stereotypes tell us liberals eat arugula and drive hatchbacks, while conservatives prefer pork rinds and pickup trucks. These two political classes are so dissimilar that people like to joke they are “wired differently.”\nBut it turns out that might literally be true. Recent brain science suggests there are measurable differences in how liberal and conservative brains process information—distinctions that could have significant impact on what happens on Election Day.\nFirst, a little background. The brain divides our thought life into two activities: appreciating what we have and desiring what we need. What we have is experienced through the five senses plus our emotions. The brain uses a cocktail of chemicals to orchestrate these experiences that might be called the “Here & Now” brain chemicals, chemicals like oxytocin, which encourages us focus on intimate relationships, and endorphins, which provide feelings of fulfillment and satisfaction.\nBy contrast, desiring what we don’t have is the domain of a single chemical in the brain: dopamine. It gives us the drive to pursue new things. You know the feeling of that dopamine “buzz” when you find a package on your doorstep and can’t wait to open it, when you think you might have a shot at a promotion, or when you’re out shopping for a new phone.\nDopamine orients us to the future. It helps us think about possibilities; not what is, but what might be. It drives the ambition of the businessman, the creativity of the artist and the speculation of the scientist. In general, the higher the dopamine level in your brain, the greater the urge you feel to find new things, to create new things—to pursue change.\nAnd we know that dopamine activity isn’t purely situational. Some people are born with genes that naturally make their dopamine circuits more active. These people are more likely than others to pursue creative endeavors. Often, they end up as actors, academics, entrepreneurs and writers.\nConsider how this might extend to politics. Progressivism, the pursuit of progress, is, by definition, the pursuit of change, of new things. So, we might expect to see progressive ideology in people with more active dopamine circuits. And that’s just what we do find. Researchers from the University of California discovered that people who inherit particularly active dopamine receptor genes are more likely to subscribe to a liberal ideology. (They also tend to get bored easily and seek novelty, and can be impulsive, exploratory, excitable, quick-tempered and extravagant.) It’s no surprise that so many actors, artists, academics and writers tend to be liberal: Dopamine may be driving both their creativity and their politics.\nSimilarly, people with lower levels of dopamine and higher levels of the “Here & Now” brain chemicals are more likely to take their enjoyment from the appreciation of things they already have. They value tradition. They take more satisfaction from the here and now enjoyment of, say, watching a football game with friends rather than the future-focused promises of a presidential debate. Not surprisingly, genes that code for a less active dopamine system have been linked to people who identify as conservative politically, who tend to prize tradition and see safety in the status quo. A study of 1,771 students in Singapore found that conservative attitudes were more common among those who had a receptor gene that was less reactive to dopamine.\nThis chemical difference can also help explain why liberals tend to be more politically engaged than conservatives. A 2017 study conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute found that liberals were more likely than conservatives to express political opinions on social media, contact elected officials, donate money to a political campaign, and attend a political rally. If a hundred liberals are marching down the street, it’s most likely a protest. With conservatives, it’s probably a parade.\nBut even though under ordinary circumstances liberals are more engaged in the political process, liberals don’t always have the enthusiasm edge. Why? Because conservative brains, chemically inclined toward preserving the here and now, are more sensitive to threats that might undermine their current way of life. When a group of volunteers were divided by political affiliation, researchers found that, compared to liberals, conservatives had a stronger physiological reaction to frightening images, such as a spider crawling on a man’s face. Also, when presented with a selection of positive and negative images, conservatives spent more time gazing at the negative images—pictures that represented a threat.\nThis neuroscience suggests that the current confrontational political climate may be helping the conservative cause. News articles that describe public harassment by activists, for example, trigger threat circuits in the brain and can turn the ordinarily complacent conservative into an enthusiastic partisan. Perhaps conservative leaders know this, which is why they frequently emphasize threats. (See the GOP midterm campaign ads accusing Democrats of encouraging “mob rule.”) In response, liberal leaders might reduce conservatives’ motivation to vote by playing down confrontation, and instead emphasizing the commonality all Americans share.\nOf course, it’s important to remember that neuroscientists study large groups of people and report on the averages. So, within each group there are plenty who buck the overall trend—call them dopaminergic conservatives and Here & Now liberals. Most scientific study tells us something about groups, but very little about individuals.\nBut it’s groups that decide elections, so it’s worth exploring how whether differences in levels of brain chemicals could have consequences in the midterm elections. Biology isn’t destiny, but when you’re playing the odds, it makes sense for both sides to pay attention to the brain.\n""]]"

A study released yesterday implies that’s definitely the case.\n\n“After these findings, it’s certainly unlikely, and perhaps impossible, that I could think about the Greenland ice sheet like I did before,” said Dr. Grant, a lead author on the study.\n\nThe study reveals a 30% greater chance that ice sheets of more than 100 square kilometers will break off of continental glaciers than ones that are 10 square kilometers or less. The simulation totally upends the widely-held assumption that smaller ice sheets are significantly more vulnerable to breaks. That assumption, according to most experts at the NOAA, is responsible for every trusted model of sea level rise that gets cited in federal reports. Still, the highly-speculative nature of the simulation has some other scientists questioning the model assumptions.\n\n“Look, we have no direct evidence of ice sheets that large having broken off in the last 30 years. That’s when models like this became somewhat more reliable in terms of available data,” said Dr. Marolf, perhaps the highest-profile NOAA member who dismissed the study. “Even before that, the few examples of breaks we’ve accounted for were so rare and poorly-understood that they constitute edge cases. And the simulation also ignores recent climate commitments from the OECD countries that should lower projected carbon emissions. So you see, this study is an extrapolation, on top of an extrapolation, on top of an extrapolation.”\n\nDr. Marolf suggests that a follow-up simulation that incorporates most of her concerns would be worth paying attention to. However, “ideally [she would] want new ice core samples from at least a quarter of the sheets they’ve pointed to” so that the previous study could be somewhat falsified. Insisting that she is “not some sort of crackpot,” Dr. Marolf made clear that every simulation should be taken seriously, even if its conclusions call for a modicum of skepticism.\n\nBut according to Dr. Grant, there’s “no chance” that the findings have zero relevance for the community as a whole. “In my book, if you dismiss simulations of this level of rigor and sophistication, you may as well dismiss the entirety of climate science,” said Dr. Grant. “For every so-called expert who questions this stuff, there are five who at least give it the benefit of the doubt.

Of those 75%, at least half cited his perceived unpopularity amongst their classmates as their top reason.\n\nThe situation is complicated by Dr. Troy’s course being a 1st year requirement for Tessamunga freshmen. In the poll, most freshmen indicated they still planned to take the class given they were already halfway through the semester.\n\nThe bombshell report that Dr. Troy was a member of SKEPTIC presents a hard choice for the institution: either fire him immediately, or admit tacit denial of modern climate science. After all, if the climate isn’t changing, how can we make sense of the Houston flooding, the 2018 California Wildfires, or the Chicago polar vortex just this year? While he now claims to be a believer, Dr. Troy thinks we have “met our quota” for disasters already this year, “unless God sees fit to rerun the 10 plagues of Egypt or give us a preview of Revelation.” \n\nAs always, it’s important to take such pronouncements with a grain of salt. In the past Dr. Troy was a member of Scientists who Know Enough about Policy Tools and Intuitive Causality (SKEPTIC), a group that infamously endorsed or rejected climate agreements based on how swollen its members’ glands were that day.\n\nFreshman Tessamunga student Sarah is dismissive of Dr. Troy’s “come to Jesus” moment on climate change. “Given how much more we know about ice cores, how much better our simulations are, how much more confident we can be in our projections, can you believe this crackpot was a SKEPTIC until 2015? Give me a break.” She cited in particular SKEPTIC’s rejection of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016, due to 12 out of 15 of its members saying “there goes my hip” the morning of its announcement.\n\nDr. Troy rejected calls for his removal. “As a member of SKEPTIC I acted with integrity. People forget that SKEPTIC actually endorsed more studies that corroborated warming global temperatures” than otherwise because “climate studies are usually released in the fall, when joints aren’t acting up. Plus, I didn’t choose the name.”\n\nThe situation is particularly controversial given recent research that reinterprets the fall of the Tessamunga tribe (the Institute’s namesake) as the first confirmed instance of climate-driven human extinction. The Tessamunga, native to what is now the greater Knoxville, Tennessee area in the 17th century, famously migrated north to escape a freak heat weave in November 1645, losing half their number to hypothermia outside what is now Toronto during the bitterly-cold winter of 1645-6. Migrating even farther south to Florida once the snow melted, the Tessamunga were almost wiped out during a scorching two-week heatwave of 110+ degrees Fahrenheit. As few as twelve made it back to Knoxville, becoming a source of local legend and folklore. \n\nA recent NOAA study that modeled climate change over the long term suggests that the semi-legendary “trials of Tessamunga”, recorded in the account of one Spanish explorer from the 1650s, occurred in the aftermath of volcanic eruptions that destabilized the atmosphere, possibly leading to short-term climate swings and explaining the tribe’s near-extinction. Indeed, after Dr. Troy’s hiring, the Twitter hashtag #neveragain has been trending among the student body.\n\nThe Institute’s President Martin dismissed the recent controversy. “We are always mindful of the credibility of our instructors and affiliates. Dr. Troy is being treated the same as we would treat any other employee and as we have operated for the entirety of my administration.” President Martin further hinted that the best way to honor the tribe’s legacy is to trust in the deliberations of the institution named for it.\n\nDr. Troy is sensitive to students’ feelings, noting that he did 23andMe after getting it last Christmas and the results showed a greater than 50% chance he himself held at least some Tessamunga genes. “We all wish we could go back to the days of the Tessamunga tribe, before capitalism, before the modern world made things complicated and uncertain. The blood of Hot Mouth, who died of a heat stroke on the Florida beach after losing his arms and legs to frostbite, flows through my veins. Like my ancestors I too wonder why the earth is sometimes so cold and so hot, and like them I have changed my positions from time to time. After all, I’m only human. Should my career be ruined to pay for yesterday’s sins?” Besides, as a new hire, Dr. Troy noted his annual salary is among the lowest of all Tessamunga faculty.\n\nUPDATE: As of Wednesday morning, #standwithhotmouth was also trending among members of the local student branch of SKEPTIC.\n""]]"

In years past, this has meant buying notebooks and pencils, perhaps even a new backpack. But over the past decade or so, the back-to-school checklist has for many also included an array of screen devices that many parents dutifully stuff into their children’s bag.\nThe screen revolution has seen pedagogy undergo a seismic shift as technology now dominates the educational landscape. In almost every classroom in America today, you will find some type of screen—smartboards, Chromebooks, tablets, smartphones. From inner-city schools to those in rural and remote towns, we have accepted tech in the classroom as a necessary and beneficial evolution in education.\n\nThis is a lie.\nTech in the classroom not only leads to worse educational outcomes for kids, which I will explain shortly, it can also clinically hurt them. I’ve worked with over a thousand teens in the past 15 years and have observed that students who have been raised on a high-tech diet not only appear to struggle more with attention and focus, but also seem to suffer from an adolescent malaise that appears to be a direct byproduct of their digital immersion. Indeed, over two hundred peer-reviewed studies point to screen time correlating to increased ADHD, screen addiction, increased aggression, depression, anxiety and even psychosis.\n\nEducation technology is estimated to become a $60 billion industry by 2018. With the advent of the Common Core in 2010, which nationalized curriculum and textbooks standards, the multi-billion-dollar textbook industry became very attractive for educational gunslingers looking to capitalize on the new Wild West of education technology. A tablet with educational software no longer needed state-by-state curricular customization. It could now be sold to the entire country.\nThis new Gold Rush attracted people like Rupert Murdoch, not otherwise known for his concern for American pedagogy, who would go on to invest over $1 billion into an ed-tech company called Amplify, with the stated mission of selling every student in America their proprietary tablet—for only $199—along with the software and annual licensing fees.\n\nAmplify hired hundreds of videogame designers to build educational videogames—while they and other tech entrepreneurs attempted to sell the notion that American students no longer had the attention span for traditional education. Their solution: Educate them in a more stimulating and “engaging” manner.\nBut let’s look more closely at that claim. ADHD rates have indeed exploded by 50 percent over the past 10 years with the CDC indicating that rates continue to rise by five percent per year. Yet many researchers and neuroscientists believe that this ADHD epidemic is a direct result of children being hyper-stimulated. Using hyper-stimulating digital content to “engage” otherwise distracted students exacerbates the problem that it endeavors to solve. It creates a vicious and addictive ADHD cycle: The more a child is stimulated, the more that child needs to keep getting stimulated in order to hold their attention.\n\nMurdoch’s Amplify wasn’t the only dubious ed-tech cash-grab. The city of Los Angeles had entered into a $1.3 billion contract in 2014 to buy iPads loaded with Pearson educational software for all of its 650,000 K through 12 students—until the FBI investigated its contract and found that now-former Superintendent John Deasy had a close relationship with Apple and Pearson executives. (Before the deal was killed in December 2014, the Pearson platform had incomplete and essentially worthless curriculum and such feeble security restrictions students that bypassed them in weeks.)\nDespite the Amplify and LA debacles, others still seek to convince naïve school administrators that screens are the educational panacea. Yet as more American schools lay off teachers while setting aside scarce budget dollars for tech, many educators and parents alike have begun to ask: Do any of these hypnotic marvels of the digital age actually produce better educational outcomes for the kids who use them.\nWe could look to Finland, whose school system routinely ranks toward the top globally and has chosen to skip the tech and standardized testing. Instead, Finnish students are given as many as four outdoor free-play breaks per day, regardless of the weather—while here, a sedentary American child sitting in front of a glowing screen playing edu-games while over-scheduled and stressed by standardized testing is seen as the Holy Grail.\n\nDr. Kentaro Toyama, an associate professor at the University of Michigan’s School of Information, once believed that technology in the classroom could solve the problems of modern urban education. No Luddite, he had received his Ph.D. in computer science from Yale and had moved to India in 2004 to help found a new research lab for Microsoft; while there, he became interested in how computers, mobile phones and other technologies could help educate India’s billion-plus population.\nRather than finding a digital educational cure, he came to understand what he calls technology’s “Law of Amplification”: technology could help education where it’s already doing well, but it does little for mediocre educational systems. Worse, in dysfunctional schools, it “can cause outright harm.” He added: “Unfortunately, there is no technological fix…more technology only magnifies socioeconomic disparities, and the only way to avoid that is non-technological.”\n\nThe list of supporting education experts and researchers is long:\n\t•\tThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said in a 2015 report that heavy users of computers in the classroom “do a lot worse in most learning outcomes” and that: “In the end, technology can amplify great teaching, but great technology cannot replace poor teaching.”\n\t•\tAn exhaustive meta-study conducted by Durham University in 2012 that systemically reviewed 48 studies examining technology’s impact on learning found that “technology-based interventions tend to produce just slightly lower levels of improvement when compared with other researched interventions and approaches.”\n\t•\tThe Alliance for Children, a consortium of some of the nation’s top educators and professors, in a 2000 report concluded: “School reform is a social challenge, not a technological problem…a high-tech agenda for children seems likely to erode our most precious long-term intellectual reserves—our children’s minds.”\n\n\t•\tPatricia Greenfield, distinguished professor of psychology at UCLA, analyzed more than 50 studies on learning and points out that reading for pleasure among young people has decreased in recent decades, which is problematic because “studies show that reading develops imagination, induction, reflection and critical thinking, as well as vocabulary…in a way that visual media such as video games and television do not.”\n\t•\tEducation psychologist and author of Failure to Connect: How Computers Affect Our Children’s Minds Jane Healy spent years doing research into computer use in schools and, while she expected to find that computers in the classroom would be beneficial, now feels that “time on the computer might interfere with development of everything from the young child’s motor skills to his or her ability to think logically and distinguish between reality and fantasy.”\n\n\t•\tJohn Vallance, a Cambridge scholar and headmaster of Australia’s top K-through-12 school, Sydney Grammer, has said: “I think when people come to write the history of this period in education…this investment in classroom technology is going to be seen as a huge fraud.”\nThere has also been surprising research coming out of Canada: Students don’t even prefer e-learning over traditional education. In a 2011 study, researchers found that students actually preferred “ordinary, real-life lessons” to using technology. Those results surprised the researchers: “It is not the portrait that we expected, whereby students would embrace anything that happens on a more highly technological level. On the contrary—they really seem to like access to human interaction, a smart person at the front of the classroom.”\n\nWe are projecting our own infatuation with shiny technology, assuming our little digital natives would rather learn using gadgets—while what they crave and need is human contact with flesh-and-blood educators.\nSchools need to heed this research in order to truly understand how to best nurture real intrinsic learning and not fall for the Siren song of the tech companies—and all of their hypnotic screens.\n""]]"

After approximately three years, about 6% of the stem cell group experienced relapses, while 60% of the people in the control group receiving standard treatment relapsed.\r\n\r\nIt’s not clear why the immune system in people with MS starts attacking its own nerve cells. But the idea of rebooting the immune system with healthy cells is one that is proving very effective in other fields as well. In cancer, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a similar strategy in which the immune cells causing certain leukemias are destroyed and replaced with genetically engineered cells that now recognize and can destroy cancer cells.\r\n\r\nMORE: Exclusive: Meet the World’s First Baby Born With an Assist from Stem Cells\r\n\r\nIn the case of MS, studies show that when the immune system is rebooted later with stem cell transplants, the immune cells generally don’t launch the same misguided assault on nerves. Some research suggests that genes, combined with exposures to environmental agents ranging from pollutants to chemicals in the diet, for example, could misdirect the immune cells to destroy neurons. Re-setting the system in people who develop the disease might erase those effects and give those with MS a chance at slowing or even beating their disease.\r\n\r\nThe results are still preliminary and were not published in a journal where other experts could analyze the data and vet the results. But the study is the first to rigorously test the stem cell transplant for MS. “The trick is going to be to determine where in the landscape of treatments we have now for MS that this is going to be appropriate to use, and who is the best candidate for this treatment,” says Bruce Bebo, executive vice president of research for the National MS Society.\r\n\r\nThe transplants are also expensive, and people who need them would likely have to go to a specialized center and work with a team of transplant and neurology experts who are familiar with the technique.\r\n\r\nBebo also notes that the trial involved people with relapsing MS, so it’s not clear whether those with progressive MS — which accounts for about half of people currently living with the disease, according to the National MS Society — might benefit. While about 80% to 85% of people first diagnosed with MS are diagnosed with the relapsing form, that can evolve into progressive MS over time. If the stem cell transplant results are confirmed, that could mean more people might be able to control their disease if they are treated early enough, before it becomes progressive and harder to treat. “That’s the hope and the promise,” says Bebo.""]]"

We all are warned about the danger of smoking cigarettes. Fortunately, vaping has been spouted as an alternative. You can even smoke cannabis through a vape now with the right battery. But now it’s time we find alternatives to our beloved bacon.\r\n\r\nTruthfully, the story is simplistic and it’s all based around a fallacy: an appeal to authority, the authority of the WHO.\r\n\r\nOften, the WHO, CDC, and other government organizations have the ability to cause a media stir just based on what they say, not even necessarily what they report.\r\n\r\nContinuing, the World Health Organization officially classified processed meats as carcinogenic in October 2015.\r\n\r\nSomehow in this hierarchy, the decision managed to be made by something called the International Agency of Research into Cancer (IARC), based on a review done on 800 studies globally.\r\n\r\nThey say the report found “sufficient evidence in humans that the consumption of processed meat causes colorectal cancer.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the IARC Report:\r\n\r\n“Meat consists of multiple components, such as haem iron. Meat can also contain chemicals that form during meat processing or cooking.\r\n\r\nFor instance, carcinogenic chemicals that form during meat processing include N-nitroso compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.\r\n\r\nCooking of red meat or processed meat also produces heterocyclic aromatic amines as well as other chemicals including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are also found in other foods and in air pollution.\r\n\r\nSome of these chemicals are known or suspected carcinogens, but despite this knowledge, it is not yet fully understood how cancer risk is increased by red meat or processed meat.”\r\n\r\nWhat’s wrong with this picture? Sure processed meat does cause cancer, but are people really so simplistic and naive to think that they need an entity called the World Health Organization to warn them?\r\n\r\nIf you don’t know processed meat is bad for you and that it causes cancer, or that most of all food we can buy nowadays is insufficient to feed us or keep us from getting sick, you don’t know how the world works.\r\n\r\nThe WHO has no genuine intention of keeping people healthy, being some altruistic force to make sure people don’t get bowel cancer. It would be naive to think that’s why they exist.\r\n\r\nSome articles go deep into the details of what percent likeliness people are to suffer from bowel cancer if they eat processed meat, but it’s hard to believe in the accuracy of these statistics when people vary so much in how they eat, and how they live.\r\n\r\nAt the root of this story, the WHO and health organizations are justifying their existence by issuing warnings about things like this. Not only that, but the WHO moves so slowly, if this was a priority to them in 2015, how could they be so late to the issue?\r\n\r\nThe WHO has a surface level, where they disclose to the public what they are researching and try to justify their existence with little warnings like this, and then they have a deeper depth of what they do and who they endorse, what research and products they promote, and all the rest.\r\n\r\nAlso, it’s not a good thing when government organizations start “officially” recognizing things. When the government starts “officially” recognizing the danger of tobacco, they start trying to make laws that do nothing but line the pockets of politicians with new taxes, and create annoying little additional hassles for people who will not give up smoking cigarettes either way.\r\n\r\nTake Australia and New Zealand for example. They have a law that bans the sale of tobacco products that don’t feature a picture of lung cancer, or mouth cancer, in place of a brand or packaging.\r\n\r\nIn the US, you go get a pack of whatever your brand cigarette is. In Australia, every brand is “lung cancer brand,” and you don’t get to roll blunts with Swisher Sweets or any of those American cigarellos that can now triumphantly be found in every gas station in America.\r\n\r\nWe don’t want the government to start officially recognizing things as carcinogenic, and anybody who does need that is relying on the wrong people for information about the world.\r\n\r\nPeople would be better off using common sense, firsthand experience, and other reliable and demonstrable, provable sources of information for which things are toxic rather than the World Health Organization. They don’t recognize a ton of other things that are harmful or carcinogenic, but they have no problem stating the obvious.""]]"

It was an ugly, smelly death, too, beginning with rattling teeth and ending with a body so rotted out from the inside that its victims could literally be startled to death by a loud noise. Just as horrifying as the disease itself, though, is that for most of those 300 years, medical experts knew how to prevent it and simply failed to.\r\n\r\nIn the 1600s, some sea captains distributed lemons, limes and oranges to sailors, driven by the belief that a daily dose of citrus fruit would stave off scurvy’s progress. The British Navy, wary of the cost of expanding the treatment, turned to malt wort, a mashed and cooked byproduct of barley which had the advantage of being cheaper but the disadvantage of doing nothing whatsoever to cure scurvy. In 1747, a British doctor named James Lind conducted an experiment where he gave one group of sailors citrus slices and the others vinegar or seawater or cider. The results couldn’t have been clearer. The crewmen who ate fruit improved so quickly that they were able to help care for the others as they languished. Lind published his findings, but died before anyone got around to implementing them nearly 50 years later.\r\n\r\nThis kind of myopia repeats throughout history. Seat belts were invented long before the automobile but weren’t mandatory in cars until the 1960s. The first confirmed death from asbestos exposure was recorded in 1906, but the U.S. didn’t start banning the substance until 1973. Every discovery in public health, no matter how significant, must compete with the traditions, assumptions and financial incentives of the society implementing it.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to one of the largest gaps between science and practice in our own time. Years from now, we will look back in horror at the counterproductive ways we addressed the obesity epidemic and the barbaric ways we treated fat people—long after we knew there was a better path.\r\n\r\nAbout 40 years ago, Americans started getting much larger. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 80 percent of adults and about one-third of children now meet the clinical definition of overweight or obese. More Americans live with “extreme obesity“ than with breast cancer, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and HIV put together.\r\n\r\nAnd the medical community’s primary response to this shift has been to blame fat people for being fat. Obesity, we are told, is a personal failing that strains our health care system, shrinks our GDP and saps our military strength. It is also an excuse to bully fat people in one sentence and then inform them in the next that you are doing it for their own good. That’s why the fear of becoming fat, or staying that way, drives Americans to spend more on dieting every year than we spend on video games or movies. Forty-five percent of adults say they’re preoccupied with their weight some or all of the time—an 11-point rise since 1990. Nearly half of 3- to 6- year old girls say they worry about being fat.\r\n\r\nThe emotional costs are incalculable. I have never written a story where so many of my sources cried during interviews, where they double- and triple-checked that I would not reveal their names, where they shook with anger describing their interactions with doctors and strangers and their own families. One remembered kids singing “Baby Beluga” as she boarded the school bus, another said she has tried diets so extreme she has passed out and yet another described the elaborate measures he takes to keep his spouse from seeing him naked in the light. A medical technician I’ll call Sam (he asked me to change his name so his wife wouldn’t find out he spoke to me) said that one glimpse of himself in a mirror can destroy his mood for days. “I have this sense I’m fat and I shouldn’t be,” he says. “It feels like the worst kind of weakness.”\r\n\r\nMy interest in this issue is slightly more than journalistic. Growing up, my mother’s weight was the uncredited co-star of every family drama, the obvious, unspoken reason why she never got out of the car when she picked me up from school, why she disappeared from the family photo album for years at a time, why she spent hours making meatloaf then sat beside us eating a bowl of carrots. Last year, for the first time, we talked about her weight in detail. When I asked if she was ever bullied, she recalled some guy calling her a “fat slob” as she biked past him years ago. “But that was rare,” she says. “The bigger way my weight affected my life was that I waited to do things because I thought fat people couldn’t do them.” She got her master’s degree at 38, her Ph.D. at 55. “I avoided so many activities where I thought my weight would discredit me.”\r\n\r\nBut my mother’s story, like Sam’s, like everyone’s, didn’t have to turn out like this. For 60 years, doctors and researchers have known two things that could have improved, or even saved, millions of lives. The first is that diets do not work. Not just paleo or Atkins or Weight Watchers or Goop, but all diets. Since 1959, research has shown that 95 to 98 percent of attempts to lose weight fail and that two-thirds of dieters gain back more than they lost. The reasons are biological and irreversible. As early as 1969, research showed that losing just 3 percent of your body weight resulted in a 17 percent slowdown in your metabolism—a body-wide starvation response that blasts you with hunger hormones and drops your internal temperature until you rise back to your highest weight. Keeping weight off means fighting your body’s energy-regulation system and battling hunger all day, every day, for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\nThe second big lesson the medical establishment has learned and rejected over and over again is that weight and health are not perfect synonyms. Yes, nearly every population-level study finds that fat people have worse cardiovascular health than thin people. But individuals are not averages: Studies have found that anywhere from one-third to three-quarters of people classified as obese are metabolically healthy. They show no signs of elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance or high cholesterol. Meanwhile, about a quarter of non-overweight people are what epidemiologists call “the lean unhealthy.” A 2016 study that followed participants for an average of 19 years found that unfit skinny people were twice as likely to get diabetes as fit fat people. Habits, no matter your size, are what really matter. Dozens of indicators, from vegetable consumption to regular exercise to grip strength, provide a better snapshot of someone’s health than looking at her from across a room.\r\n\r\nThe terrible irony is that for 60 years, we’ve approached the obesity epidemic like a fad dieter: If we just try the exact same thing one more time, we'll get a different result. And so it’s time for a paradigm shift. We’re not going to become a skinnier country. But we still have a chance to become a healthier one.\r\n\r\nThis is Corissa Enneking at her lightest: She wakes up, showers and smokes a cigarette to keep her appetite down. She drives to her job at a furniture store, she stands in four-inch heels all day, she eats a cup of yogurt alone in her car on her lunch break. After work, lightheaded, her feet throbbing, she counts out three Ritz crackers, eats them at her kitchen counter and writes down the calories in her food journal.\r\n\r\nOr not. Some days she comes home and goes straight to bed, exhausted and dizzy from hunger, shivering in the Kansas heat. She rouses herself around dinnertime and drinks some orange juice or eats half a granola bar. Occasionally she’ll just sleep through the night, waking up the next day to start all over again.\r\n\r\nThe last time she lived like this, a few years ago, her mother marched her to the hospital. “My daughter is sick,” she told the doctor. “She's not eating.” He looked Enneking up and down. Despite six months of starvation, she was still wearing plus sizes, still couldn’t shop at J. Crew, still got unsolicited diet advice from colleagues and customers.\r\n\r\nEnneking told the doctor that she used to be larger, that she’d lost some weight the same way she had lost it three or four times before—seeing how far she could get through the day without eating, trading solids for liquids, food for sleep. She was hungry all the time, but she was learning to like it. When she did eat, she got panic attacks. Her boss was starting to notice her erratic behavior.\r\n\r\n“Well, whatever you're doing now,” the doctor said, “it's working.” He urged her to keep it up and assured her that once she got small enough, her body would start to process food differently. She could add a few hundred calories to her diet. Her period would come back. She would stay small, but without as much effort.\r\n\r\n“If you looked at anything other than my weight,” Enneking says now, “I had an eating disorder. And my doctor was congratulating me.”\r\n\r\nAsk almost any fat person about her interactions with the health care system and you will hear a story, sometimes three, the same as Enneking’s: rolled eyes, skeptical questions, treatments denied or delayed or revoked. Doctors are supposed to be trusted authorities, a patient’s primary gateway to healing. But for fat people, they are a source of unique and persistent trauma. No matter what you go in for or how much you’re hurting, the first thing you will be told is that it would all get better if you could just put down the Cheetos.\r\n\r\nEmily went to a gynecological surgeon to have an ovarian cyst removed. \r\n\r\nThis phenomenon is not merely anecdotal. Doctors have shorter appointments with fat patients and show less emotional rapport in the minutes they do have. Negative words—“noncompliant,” “overindulgent,” “weak willed”—pop up in their medical histories with higher frequency. In one study, researchers presented doctors with case histories of patients suffering from migraines. With everything else being equal, the doctors reported that the patients who were also classified as fat had a worse attitude and were less likely to follow their advice. And that’s when they see fat patients at all: In 2011, the Sun-Sentinel polled OB-GYNs in South Florida and discovered that 14 percent had barred all new patients weighing more than 200 pounds.\r\n\r\nSome of these doctors are simply applying the same presumptions as the society around them. An anesthesiologist on the West Coast tells me that as soon as a larger patient goes under, the surgeons start trading “high school insults” about her body over the operating table. Janice O’Keefe, a former nurse in Boston, tells me a doctor once looked at her, paused, then asked, “How could you do this to yourself?” Emily, a counselor in Eastern Washington, went to a gynecological surgeon to have an ovarian cyst removed. The physician pointed out her body fat on the MRI, then said, “Look at that skinny woman in there trying to get out.”\r\n\r\n“I was worried I had cancer,” Emily says, “and she was turning it into a teachable moment about my weight.”\r\n\r\nOther physicians sincerely believe that shaming fat people is the best way to motivate them to lose weight. “It’s the last area of medicine where we prescribe tough love,” says Mayo Clinic researcher Sean Phelan.\r\n\r\nIn a 2013 journal article, bioethicist Daniel Callahan argued for more stigma against fat people. “People don’t realize that they are obese or if they do realize it, it’s not enough to stir them to do anything about it,” he tells me. Shame helped him kick his cigarette habit, he argues, so it should work for obesity too.\r\n\r\nThis belief is cartoonishly out of step with a generation of research into obesity and human behavior. As one of the (many) stigma researchers who responded to Callahan’s article pointed out, shaming smokers and drug users with D.A.R.E.-style “just say no” messages may have actually increased substance abuse by making addicts less likely to bring up their habit with their doctors and family members.\r\n\r\nPlus, rather obviously, smoking is a behavior; being fat is not. Jody Dushay, an endocrinologist and obesity specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, says most of her patients have tried dozens of diets and have lost and regained hundreds of pounds before they come to her. Telling them to try again, but in harsher terms, only sets them up to fail and then blame themselves.\r\n\r\nNot all physicians set out to denigrate their fat patients, of course; some of them do damage because of subtler, more unconscious biases. Most doctors, for example, are fit—“If you go to an obesity conference, good luck trying to get a treadmill at 5 a.m.,” Dushay says—and have spent more than a decade of their lives in the high-stakes, high-stress bubble of medical schools. According to several studies, thin doctors are more confident in their recommendations, expect their patients to lose more weight and are more likely to think dieting is easy. Sarah (not her real name), a tech CEO in New England, once told her doctor that she was having trouble eating less throughout the day. “Look at me,” her doctor said. “I had one egg for breakfast and I feel fine.”\r\n\r\nThen there are the glaring cultural differences. Kenneth Resnicow, a consultant who trains physicians to build rapport with their patients, says white, wealthy, skinny doctors will often try to bond with their low-income patients by telling them, “I know what it’s like not to have time to cook.” Their patients, who might be single mothers with three kids and two jobs, immediately think “No, you don’t,” and the relationship is irretrievably soured.\r\n\r\nWhen Joy Cox, an academic in New Jersey, was 16, she went to the hospital with stomach pains. The doctor didn’t diagnose her dangerously inflamed bile duct, but he did, out of nowhere, suggest that she’d get better if she stopped eating so much fried chicken. “He managed to denigrate my fatness and my blackness in the same sentence,” she says.\r\n\r\nMany of the financial and administrative structures doctors work within help reinforce this bad behavior. The problem starts in medical school, where, according to a 2015 survey, students receive an average of just 19 hours of nutrition education over four years of instruction—five hours fewer than they got in 2006. Then the trouble compounds once doctors get into daily practice. Primary care physicians only get 15 minutes for each appointment, barely enough time to ask patients what they ate today, much less during all the years leading up to it. And a more empathic approach to treatment simply doesn’t pay: While procedures like blood tests and CT scans command reimbursement rates from hundreds to thousands of dollars, doctors receive as little as $24 to provide a session of diet and nutrition counseling.\r\n\r\nLesley Williams, a family medicine doctor in Phoenix, tells me she gets an alert from her electronic health records software every time she’s about to see a patient who is above the “overweight” threshold. The reason for this is that physicians are often required, in writing, to prove to hospital administrators and insurance providers that they have brought up their patient’s weight and formulated a plan to bring it down—regardless of whether that patient came in with arthritis or a broken arm or a bad sunburn. Failing to do that could result in poor performance reviews, low ratings from insurance companies or being denied reimbursement if they refer patients to specialized care.\r\n\r\nAnother issue, says Kimberly Gudzune, an obesity specialist at Johns Hopkins, is that many doctors, no matter their specialty, think weight falls under their authority. Gudzune often spends months working with patients to set realistic goals—playing with their grandkids longer, going off a cholesterol medication—only to have other doctors threaten it all. One of her patients was making significant progress until she went to a cardiologist who told her to lose 100 pounds. “All of a sudden she goes back to feeling like a failure and we have to start over,” Gudzune says. “Or maybe she just never comes back at all.”\r\n\r\nAnd so, working within a system that neither trains nor encourages them to meaningfully engage with their higher-weight patients, doctors fall back on recommending fad diets and delivering bland motivational platitudes. Ron Kirk, an electrician in Boston, says that for years, his doctor's first resort was to put him on some diet he couldn't maintain for more than a few weeks. “They told me lettuce was a ‘free’ food,” he says—and he’d find himself carving up a head of romaine for dinner.\r\n\r\nIn a study that recorded 461 interactions with doctors, only 13 percent of patients got any specific plan for diet or exercise and only 5 percent got help arranging a follow-up visit. “It can be stressful when [patients] start asking a lot of specific questions” about diet and weight loss, one doctor told researchers in 2012. “I don’t feel like I have the time to sit there and give them private counseling on basics. I say, ‘Here’s some websites, look at this.’” A 2016 survey found that nearly twice as many higher-weight Americans have tried meal-replacement diets—the kind most likely to fail—than have ever received counseling from a dietician.\r\n\r\n“It borders on medical malpractice,” says Andrew (not his real name), a consultant and musician who has been large his whole life. A few years ago, on a routine visit, Andrew’s doctor weighed him, announced that he was “dangerously overweight” and told him to diet and exercise, offering no further specifics. Should he go on a low-fat diet? Low-carb? Become a vegetarian? Should he do Crossfit? Yoga? Should he buy a fucking ThighMaster?\r\n\r\n“She didn't even ask me what I was already doing for exercise,” he says. “At the time, I was training for serious winter mountaineering trips, hiking every weekend and going to the gym four times a week. Instead of a conversation, I got a sound bite. It felt like shaming me was the entire purpose.”\r\n\r\nAll of this makes higher-weight patients more likely to avoid doctors. Three separate studies have found that fat women are more likely to die from breast and cervical cancers than non-fat women, a result partially attributed to their reluctance to see doctors and get screenings. Erin Harrop, a researcher at the University of Washington, studies higher-weight women with anorexia, who, contrary to the size-zero stereotype of most media depictions, are twice as likely to report vomiting, using laxatives and abusing diet pills. Thin women, Harrop discovered, take around three years to get into treatment, while her participants spent an average of 13 and a half years waiting for their disorders to be addressed.\r\n\r\n“A lot of my job is helping people heal from the trauma of interacting with the medical system,” says Ginette Lenham, a counselor who specializes in obesity. The rest of it, she says, is helping them heal from the trauma of interacting with everyone else.\r\n\r\nIf Sonya ever forgets that she is fat, the world will remind her. She has stopped taking the bus, she tells me, because she can sense the aggravation of the passengers squeezing past her. Sarah, the tech CEO, tenses up when anyone brings bagels to a work meeting. If she reaches for one, are her employees thinking, “There goes the fat boss”? If she doesn’t, are they silently congratulating her for showing some restraint?\r\n\r\nEmily says it’s the do-gooders who get to her, the women who stop her on the street and tell her how brave she is for wearing a sleeveless dress on a 95-degree day. Sam, the medical technician, avoids the subject of weight altogether. “Men aren’t supposed to think about this stuff—and I think about it constantly,” he admits. “So I never let myself talk about it. Which is weird because it’s the most visible thing about me.”\r\n\r\nAgain and again I hear stories of how the pressure to be a “good fatty” in public builds up and explodes. Jessica has four kids. Every week is a birthday party or family reunion or swimming pool social, another opportunity to stand around platters of spare ribs and dinner rolls with her fellow moms.\r\n\r\n“Your conscious mind is busy the whole day with how many calories is in everything, what you can eat and who’s watching,” she says. After a few intrusive comments over the years—should you be eating that?—she has learned to be careful, to perform the role of the impeccable fat person. She nibbles on cherry tomatoes, drinks tap water, stays on her feet, ignores the dessert end of the buffet.\r\n\r\nThen, as the gathering winds down, Jessica and the other parents divvy up the leftovers. She wraps up burgers or pasta salad or birthday cake, drives her children home and waits for the moment when they are finally in bed. Then, when she’s alone, she eats all the leftovers by herself, in the dark.\r\n\r\n“It’s always hidden,” she says. “I buy a package of ice cream, then eat it all. Then I have to go to the store to buy it again. For a week my family thinks there’s a thing of ice cream in the fridge—but it’s actually five different ones.”\r\n\r\nThis is how fat-shaming works: It is visible and invisible, public and private, hidden and everywhere at the same time. Research consistently finds that larger Americans (especially larger women) earn lower salaries and are less likely to be hired and promoted. In a 2017 survey, 500 hiring managers were given a photo of an overweight female applicant. Twenty-one percent of them described her as unprofessional despite having no other information about her. What’s worse, only a few cities and one state (nice work, Michigan) officially prohibit workplace discrimination on the basis of weight.\r\n\r\nParadoxically, as the number of larger Americans has risen, the biases against them have become more severe. More than 40 percent of Americans classified as obese now say they experience stigma on a daily basis, a rate far higher than any other minority group. And this does terrible things to their bodies. According to a 2015 study, fat people who feel discriminated against have shorter life expectancies than fat people who don't. “These findings suggest the possibility that the stigma associated with being overweight,” the study concluded, “is more harmful than actually being overweight.”\r\n\r\nAnd, in a cruel twist, one effect of weight bias is that it actually makes you eat more. The stress hormone cortisol—the one evolution designed to kick in when you’re being chased by a tiger or, it turns out, rejected for your looks—increases appetite, reduces the will to exercise and even improves the taste of food. Sam, echoing so many of the other people I spoke with, says that he drove straight to Jack in the Box last year after someone yelled, “Eat less!” at him across a parking lot.\r\n\r\nThere’s a grim caveman logic to our nastiness toward fat people. “We’re attuned to bodies that look different,” says Janet Tomiyama, a stigma researcher at UCLA. “In our evolutionary past, that might have meant disease risk and been seen as a threat to your tribe.” These biological breadcrumbs help explain why stigma begins so early. Kids as young as 3 describe their larger classmates with words like “mean,” “stupid” and “lazy.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet, despite weight being the number one reason children are bullied at school, America’s institutions of public health continue to pursue policies perfectly designed to inflame the cruelty. TV and billboard campaigns still use slogans like “Too much screen time, too much kid” and “Being fat takes the fun out of being a kid.” Cat Pausé, a researcher at Massey University in New Zealand, spent months looking for a single public health campaign, worldwide, that attempted to reduce stigma against fat people and came up empty. In an incendiary case of good intentions gone bad, about a dozen states now send children home with “BMI report cards,” an intervention unlikely to have any effect on their weight but almost certain to increase bullying from the people closest to them.\r\n\r\nThis is not an abstract concern: Surveys of higher-weight adults find that their worst experiences of discrimination come from their own families. Erika, a health educator in Washington, can still recite the word her father used to describe her: “husky.” Her grandfather preferred “stocky.” Her mother never said anything about Erika’s body, but she didn't have to. She obsessed over her own, calling herself “enormous” despite being two sizes smaller than her daughter. By the time Erika was 11, she was sneaking into the woods behind her house and vomiting into the creek whenever social occasions made starving herself impossible.\r\n\r\nAnd the abuse from loved ones continues well into adulthood. A 2017 survey found that 89 percent of obese adults had been bullied by their romantic partners. Emily, the counselor, says she spent her teens and 20s “sleeping with guys I wasn’t interested in because they wanted to sleep with me.” In her head, a guy being into her was a rare and depletable resource she couldn’t afford to waste: “I was desperate for men to give me attention. Sex was a good way to do that.”\r\n\r\nEventually, she ended up with someone abusive. He told her during sex that her body was beautiful and then, in the daylight, that it was revolting. “Whenever I tried to leave him, he would say, ‘Where are you gonna find someone who will put up with your disgusting body?’” she remembers.\r\n\r\nEmily finally managed to get away from him, but she is aware that her love life will always be fraught. The guy she’s dating now is thin—“think Tony Hawk,” she says—and she notices the looks they get when they hold hands in public. “That never used to happen when I dated fat dudes,” she says. “Thin men are not allowed to be attracted to fat women.”\r\n\r\nThe effects of weight bias get worse when they’re layered on top of other types of discrimination. A 2012 study found that African-American women are more likely to become depressed after internalizing weight stigma than white women. Hispanic and black teenagers also have significantly higher rates of bulimia. And, in a remarkable finding, rich people of color have higher rates of cardiovascular disease than poor people of color—the opposite of what happens with white people. One explanation is that navigating increasingly white spaces, and increasingly higher stakes, exerts stress on racial minorities that, over time, makes them more susceptible to heart problems.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most unique aspect of weight stigma is how it isolates its victims from one another. For most minority groups, discrimination contributes to a sense of belongingness, a community in opposition to a majority. Gay people like other gay people; Mormons root for other Mormons. Surveys of higher-weight people, however, reveal that they hold many of the same biases as the people discriminating against them. In a 2005 study, the words obese participants used to classify other obese people included gluttonous, unclean and sluggish.\r\n\r\nAndrea, a retired nurse in Boston, has been on commercial diets since she was 10 years old. She knows how hard it is to slim down, knows what women larger than her are going through, but she still struggles not to pass judgment when she sees them in public. “I think, ‘How did they let it happen?’” she says. “It’s more like fear. Because if I let myself go, I’ll be that big too.”\r\n\r\nHer position is all-too understandable. As young as 9 or 10, I knew that coming out of the closet is what gay people do, even if it took me another decade to actually do it. Fat people, though, never get a moment of declaring their identity, of marking themselves as part of a distinct group. They still live in a society that believes weight is temporary, that losing it is urgent and achievable, that being comfortable in their bodies is merely “glorifying obesity.” This limbo, this lie, is why it’s so hard for fat people to discover one another or even themselves. “No one believes our It Gets Better story,” says Tigress Osborn, the director of community outreach for the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance. “You can’t claim an identity if everyone around you is saying it doesn’t or shouldn’t exist.”\r\n\r\nHarrop, the eating disorders researcher, realized several years ago that her university had clubs for trans students, immigrant students, Republican students, but none for fat students. So she started one—and it has been a resounding, unmitigated failure. Only a handful of fat people have ever showed up; most of the time, thin folks sit around brainstorming about how to be better allies.\r\n\r\nI ask Harrop why she thinks the group has been such a bust. It’s simple, she says: “Fat people grow up in the same fat-hating culture that non-fat people do.”\r\n\r\nSince 1980, the obesity rate has doubled in 73 countries and increased in 113 others. And in all that time, no nation has reduced its obesity rate. Not one.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that in America, like everywhere else, our institutions of public health have become so obsessed with body weight that they have overlooked what is really killing us: our food supply. Diet is the leading cause of death in the United States, responsible for more than five times the fatalities of gun violence and car accidents combined. But it’s not how much we’re eating—Americans actually consume fewer calories now than we did in 2003. It’s what we’re eating.\r\n\r\nFor more than a decade now, researchers have found that the quality of our food affects disease risk independently of its effect on weight. Fructose, for example, appears to damage insulin sensitivity and liver function more than other sweeteners with the same number of calories. People who eat nuts four times a week have 12 percent lower diabetes incidence and a 13 percent lower mortality rate regardless of their weight. All of our biological systems for regulating energy, hunger and satiety get thrown off by eating foods that are high in sugar, low in fiber and injected with additives. And which now, shockingly, make up 60 percent of the calories we eat.\r\n\r\nDraining this poison from our trillion-dollar food system is not going to happen quickly or easily. Every link in the chain, from factory farms to school lunches, is dominated by a Mars or a Monsanto or a McDonald’s, each working tirelessly to lower its costs and raise its profits. But that’s still no reason to despair. There’s a lot we can do right now to improve fat people’s lives—to shift our focus for the first time from weight to health and from shame to support.\r\n\r\nThe place to start is at the doctor’s office. The central failure of the medical system when it comes to obesity is that it treats every patient exactly the same: If you’re fat, lose some weight. If you’re skinny, keep up the good work. Stephanie Sogg, a psychologist at the Mass General Weight Center, tells me she has clients who start eating compulsively after a sexual assault, others who starve themselves all day before bingeing on the commute home and others who eat 1,000 calories a day, work out five times a week and still insist that they’re fat because they “have no willpower.”\r\n\r\nAcknowledging the infinite complexity of each person’s relationship to food, exercise and body image is at the center of her treatment, not a footnote to it. “Eighty percent of my patients cry in the first appointment,” Sogg says. “For something as emotional as weight, you have to listen for a long time before you give any advice. Telling someone, 'Lay off the cheeseburgers' is never going to work if you don't know what those cheeseburgers are doing for them.”\r\n\r\nThe medical benefits of this approach—being nicer to her patients than they are to themselves, is how Sogg describes it—are unimpeachable. In 2017, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the expert panel that decides which treatments should be offered for free under Obamacare, found that the decisive factor in obesity care was not the diet patients went on, but how much attention and support they received while they were on it. Participants who got more than 12 sessions with a dietician saw significant reductions in their rates of prediabetes and cardiovascular risk. Those who got less personalized care showed almost no improvement at all.\r\n\r\nStill, despite the Task Force’s explicit recommendation of “intensive, multicomponent behavioral counseling” for higher-weight patients, the vast majority of insurance companies and state health care programs define this term to mean just a session or two—exactly the superficial approach that years of research says won’t work. “Health plans refuse to treat this as anything other than a personal problem,” says Chris Gallagher, a policy consultant at the Obesity Action Coalition.\r\n\r\nThe same scurvy-ish negligence shows up at every level of government. From marketing rules to antitrust regulations to international trade agreements, U.S. policy has created a food system that excels at producing flour, sugar and oil but struggles to deliver nutrients at anywhere near the same scale. The United States spends $1.5 billion on nutrition research every year compared to around $60 billion on drug research. Just 4 percent of agricultural subsidies go to fruits and vegetables. No wonder that the healthiest foods can cost up to eight times more, calorie for calorie, than the unhealthiest—or that the gap gets wider every year.\r\n\r\nIt’s the same with exercise. The cardiovascular risks of sedentary lifestyles, suburban sprawl and long commutes are well-documented. But rather than help mitigate these risks—and their disproportionate impact on the poor—our institutions have exacerbated them. Only 13 percent of American children walk or bike to school; once they arrive, less than a third of them will take part in a daily gym class. Among adults, the number of workers commuting more than 90 minutes each way grew by more than 15 percent from 2005 to 2016, a predictable outgrowth of America’s underinvestment in public transportation and over-investment in freeways, parking and strip malls. For 40 years, as politicians have told us to eat more vegetables and take the stairs instead of the elevator, they have presided over a country where daily exercise has become a luxury and eating well has become extortionate.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that the best ideas for reversing these trends have already been tested. Many “failed” obesity interventions are, in fact, successful eat-healthier-and-exercise-more interventions. A review of 44 international studies found that school-based activity programs didn’t affect kids’ weight, but improved their athletic ability, tripled the amount of time they spent exercising and reduced their daily TV consumption by up to an hour. Another survey showed that two years of getting kids to exercise and eat better didn’t noticeably affect their size but did improve their math scores—an effect that was greater for black kids than white kids.\r\n\r\nYou see this in so much of the research: The most effective health interventions aren't actually health interventions—they are policies that ease the hardship of poverty and free up time for movement and play and parenting. Developing countries with higher wages for women have lower obesity rates, and lives are transformed when healthy food is made cheaper. A pilot program in Massachusetts that gave food stamp recipients an extra 30 cents for every $1 they spent on healthy food increased fruit and vegetable consumption by 26 percent. Policies like this are unlikely to affect our weight. They are almost certain, however, to significantly improve our health.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to the most hard-wired problem of all: Our shitty attitudes toward fat people. According to Patrick Corrigan, the editor of the journal Stigma and Health, even the most well-intentioned efforts to reduce stigma break down in the face of reality. In one study, researchers told 10- to 12-year-olds all the genetic and medical factors that contribute to obesity. Afterward, the kids could recite back the message they received—fat kids didn’t get that way by choice—but they still had the same negative attitudes about the bigger kids sitting next to them. A similar approach with fifth- and sixth-graders actually increased their intention of bullying their fat classmates. Celebrity representation, meanwhile, can result in what Corrigan calls the “Thurgood Marshall effect”: Instead of updating our stereotypes (maybe fat people aren’t so bad), we just see prominent minorities as isolated exceptions to them (well, he’s not like those other fat people).\r\n\r\nWhat does work, Corrigan says, is for fat people to make it clear to everyone they interact with that their size is nothing to apologize for. “When you pity someone, you think they’re less effective, less competent, more hurt,” he says. “You don’t see them as capable. The only way to get rid of stigma is from power.”\r\n\r\nThis has always been the great hope of the fat-acceptance movement. (“We’re here, we’re spheres, get used to it” was one of the slogans in the 1990s.) But this radical message has long since been co-opted by clothing brands, diet companies and soap corporations. Weight Watchers has rebranded as a “lifestyle program,” but still promises that its members can shrink their way to happiness. Mainstream apparel companies market themselves as “body positive” but refuse to make clothes that fit the plus-size models on their own billboards. Social media, too, has provided a platform for positive representations of fat people and formed communities that make it easier to find each other. But it has also contributed to an anodyne, narrow, Dr. Phil-approved form of progress that celebrates the female entrepreneur who sells “fatkinis” on Instagram, while ignoring the woman who (true story) gets fired from her management position after reportedly gaining 100 pounds over three years.\r\n\r\n“Fat activism isn’t about making people feel better about themselves,” Pausé says. “It’s about not being denied your civil rights and not dying because a doctor misdiagnoses you.”\r\n\r\nAnd so, in a world that refuses to change, it is still up to every fat person, alone, to decide how to endure. Emily, the counselor in Eastern Washington, says she made a choice about three years ago to assert herself. The first time she asked for a table instead of a booth at a restaurant, she says, she was sweating, flushed, her chest heaving. It felt like saying the words—“I can’t fit”—would dry up in her mouth as she said them.\r\n\r\nBut now, she says, “It’s just something I do.” Last month, she was at a conference and asked one of the other participants if he would trade chairs because his didn’t have arms. Like most of these requests, it was no big deal. “A tall person wouldn’t feel weird asking that, so why should I?” she says. Her skinny friends have started to inquire about the seating at restaurants before Emily even gets the chance.\r\n\r\nHearing about Emily’s progress reminds me of a conversation I had with Ginette Lenham, the diet counselor. Her patients, she says, often live in the past or the future with their weight. They tell her they are waiting until they are smaller to go back to school or apply for a new job. They beg her to return them to their high school or wedding or first triathlon weight, the one that will bring back their former life.\r\n\r\nAnd then Lenham must explain that these dreams are a trap. Because there is no magical cure. There is no time machine. There is only the revolutionary act of being fat and happy in a world that tells you that’s impossible.\r\n\r\n“We all have to do our best with the body that we have,” she says. “And leave everyone else’s alone.”""]]"

They found that these increasingly popular devices blast bacteria from people’s poorly washed hands (most people don’t wash their hands correctly) into the air and onto nearby surfaces in disturbing quantities, increasing the likelihood that you'll walk out of the bathroom covered in other people's germs.\r\n\r\nIn lab-based experiments recreating a public washroom, jet-air dryers introduced 27 times more bacteria into the air than good-old-fashioned paper towels, and these microbes circulated for 15 minutes afterward. \r\n\r\nNow, the authors are back with even more evidence against hand dryers, this time from real-world experiments.\r\n\r\nAs reported in the Journal of Hospital Infection, Professor Mark Wilcox and his colleagues set out to examine how hand drying methods affect bacterial spread in hospital bathrooms – an important issue because many serious and antibiotic-resistant infections are known to circulate in clinical settings.\r\n\r\nThe investigation was conducted in hospitals in three cities – Leeds, Paris, and Udine, Italy – over a 12-week period. For each location, two restrooms used by patients, staff, and visitors were selected, and each was set up to offer only a jet dryer or paper towels. Samples of the air and swabs of restroom surfaces were taken every day for four weeks, then, after a two-week pause in collections, each restroom switched to offer the alternate drying method. This process was then repeated a third time.\r\n\r\nCultures from these samples revealed that the total amount of bacteria in the air and on surfaces was consistently much higher in all restrooms when jet dryers were being used. The most dramatic differences were seen between the surface of the jet dryer itself and the surface of the paper towel dispenser: In Udine, the dryer was covered in 100 times more bacteria, in Paris it was 33-fold higher, and in Leeds it was 22-fold.\r\n\r\nIn the UK restrooms, the notorious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacterium was found three times more frequently during jet dryer usage periods than paper towel periods. Bacterial species resistant to both penicillins and cephalosporins (known as ESBL-producing organisms) and species of pathogenic enterococci – a difficult-to-treat group – were found in significantly higher frequency and counts during these periods as well.\r\n\r\nIn the Parisian and Italian hospitals, few pathogenic or drug-resistant bacteria were encountered during either hand drying set-up.\r\n\r\n“Consequently, we believe that electric hand dryers are not suited to clinical settings, and, as such, existing (e.g. NHS) infection control building guidance needs to be amended and strengthened,” Wilcox’s team wrote, adding that there is little justification for their use in any public setting given the risks they present.\r\n\r\nBased on the earlier research, French health officials recently updated their guidelines to discourage use of hand dryers in clinical wards.

You don’t have a fever, but you feel wiped out—like you could curl up on the floor and fall asleep. Do you have a cold or the flu?\r\n\r\nIf you guessed cold, you’re probably right. But experts say that differentiating the common cold (an upper respiratory infection) from the flu (influenza) can be trickier than most people assume.\r\n\r\n“There is huge overlap among non-influenza viruses and the symptoms produced by influenza and other bugs,” says Dr. Bruce Barrett, a professor of family medicine and community health at the University of Wisconsin. While many people associate the flu with a fever, Barrett says this isn’t always true. “Unless someone comes in during the peak of flu season”—a two-month period that typically lands somewhere between November and March—“I can’t tell very well whether it’s cold or flu based solely on symptoms,” he says.\r\n\r\nBut while colds and flu can in many cases look a lot alike, there are some predictable differences. For one thing, colds usually take a few days to build up, while the flu comes on more abruptly. “Sometimes [a flu] patient goes from well to very sick in a few minutes,” says Dr. Jeffrey Steinbauer, a professor of family and community medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.\r\n\r\nCold and flu symptoms\r\nA cold typically lasts about three to five days, while a flu tends to linger about twice that long, Steinbauer says. Also, a fever is much more common among flu patients, and the same is true of headaches, body aches and a dry cough. On the other hand, if you have a cough that produces a lot of fluid or mucous, you have a sore throat and you’re sneezing or dealing with a runny nose or head congestion, all of those symptoms are more typical of colds, he says. (Worth noting: a stomachache, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms can crop up in kids, but they’re not common among adults suffering from either a cold or flu. If you have these symptoms, you’re probably dealing with a stomach virus or a food-borne illness.)\r\n\r\nThe timing of your symptoms can also be revealing. Colds are most common in early fall (usually right when students return to school) and in spring. But they’re a year-round concern, says Dr. William Norcross, a principal investigator in public health at the University of California, San Diego. “They are somewhat more common in winter when people commonly gather indoors,” he says. But you can catch a cold any time, whereas the flu is usually confined to its winter schedule.\r\n\r\nLook at the two under a microscope, and you’ll see more differences. The flu is spread by two families of virus known as influenza A and influenza B, Norcross explains. Within these two families there’s a great deal of variation, which is why the composition of the flu vaccine changes from year to year and is not always as effective as public health officials hope.\r\n\r\nCommon colds, on the other hand, are caused by more than 200 different subtypes of respiratory virus, says Dr. Kyle Sue, a clinical assistant professor of family medicine at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada. These include rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and others—each of which can result in different symptoms and severities.\r\n\r\nWhile the common cold and flu can seem quite alike, there’s one very important distinction: one is deadly, and the other is not. “Influenza kills about 35,000 Americans per year, whereas colds rarely cause lasting harm,” Norcross says. For the most vulnerable people—which includes those with weakened immune systems, the very old and babies born prematurely—the flu is a common cause of pneumonia and death, the CDC warns.\r\n\r\nHow to prevent spreading the flu\r\nBecause of these risks, and because the symptoms of colds and flu can be hard to tell apart, experts say that it’s vital for people to take steps to prevent the spread of these viruses. “When you are sick with influenza or a cold, your mucus, saliva and everything coming from your nose, mouth and throat down to your lungs is teeming with millions of highly infectious virus particles,” Norcross says. Sneezing, coughing or any other activities that transfer your mucous to your environment could make other people sick.\r\n\r\nIf you’re feeling unwell, the best thing you can do is to isolate yourself until your symptoms go away. “If you go to work, the store or take the subway, you are likely to spread the illness,” he says. If you have to leave the house, avoid touching your mouth or nose, wash your hands frequently and try to cough or sneeze into the crook of your arm.\r\n\r\nIt’s also crucial that you get a flu shot—preferably before the end of October. Depending on how well the vaccine’s developers did at anticipating the season’s influenza strains, the flu shot’s effectiveness can vary from about 50% to 90%, Norcross says.\r\n\r\nWhile saving yourself from suffering is one good reason to get the shot, another is to save lives. By vaccinating yourself against the flu, you’ll be much less likely to acquire and spread it to at-risk groups, Barrett says. “If we can get 30% to 40% of the population vaccinated, we’ll save 10,000 lives,” he adds.\r\n\r\nHow to treat the flu\r\nWhen it comes to treating the flu, antiviral drugs (such as Tamiflu) can reduce the illness’s length and severity, Barrett says. But these drugs need to be taken right away—within 36 hours once symptoms begin. “They’re useless after that,” he says. If flu symptoms hit you hard and you can see a doctor right away, these drugs may be helpful. Also, anyone at risk for serious complications—the very old, the very young and those with weakened immune systems—should tell their doctor if they’re experiencing symptoms.\r\n\r\nBut for healthy adults and kids, colds and flu usually don’t require a doctor’s attention. “I do not want people coming in for upper respiratory infections, because there’s not much we can do for them,” Barrett says. Even for people who believe they have the flu, most are better off just weathering the illness at home, he says. You’ll be less likely to infect others that way, he says, and both colds and flu resolve on their own—usually within a week. If that much time passes and your symptoms aren’t improving, or they seem to be getting worse even after the first few days, it’s time to see a doctor. The same holds if your fever reaches 103 F.\r\n\r\nIf your symptoms are making you miserable, over-the-counter medications can offer short-term relief, says Steinbauer. You could take aspirin or acetaminophen for a fever, or decongestants for your runny nose. Zinc lozenges may also help curtail your cold, research has found. But time, rest and plenty of water and other fluids are the only true cures.""]]"

American psychiatrists had produced a book that would lay out, in detail, all the symptoms of different mental illnesses, so they could be identified and treated in the same way across the United States. It was called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. In the latest edition, they laid out nine symptoms that a patient has to show to be diagnosed with depression – like, for example, decreased interest in pleasure or persistent low mood. For a doctor to conclude you were depressed, you had to show five of these symptoms over several weeks.\r\n\r\nThe manual was sent out to doctors across the US and they began to use it to diagnose people. However, after a while they came back to the authors and pointed out something that was bothering them. If they followed this guide, they had to diagnose every grieving person who came to them as depressed and start giving them medical treatment. If you lose someone, it turns out that these symptoms will come to you automatically. So, the doctors wanted to know, are we supposed to start drugging all the bereaved people in America?\r\n\r\nThe authors conferred, and they decided that there would be a special clause added to the list of symptoms of depression. None of this applies, they said, if you have lost somebody you love in the past year. In that situation, all these symptoms are natural, and not a disorder. It was called “the grief exception”, and it seemed to resolve the problem.\r\n\r\nThen, as the years and decades passed, doctors on the frontline started to come back with another question. All over the world, they were being encouraged to tell patients that depression is, in fact, just the result of a spontaneous chemical imbalance in your brain – it is produced by low serotonin, or a natural lack of some other chemical. It’s not caused by your life – it’s caused by your broken brain. Some of the doctors began to ask how this fitted with the grief exception. If you agree that the symptoms of depression are a logical and understandable response to one set of life circumstances – losing a loved one – might they not be an understandable response to other situations? What about if you lose your job? What if you are stuck in a job that you hate for the next 40 years? What about if you are alone and friendless?\r\n\r\nThe grief exception seemed to have blasted a hole in the claim that the causes of depression are sealed away in your skull. It suggested that there are causes out here, in the world, and they needed to be investigated and solved there. This was a debate that mainstream psychiatry (with some exceptions) did not want to have. So, they responded in a simple way – by whittling away the grief exception. With each new edition of the manual they reduced the period of grief that you were allowed before being labelled mentally ill – down to a few months and then, finally, to nothing at all. Now, if your baby dies at 10am, your doctor can diagnose you with a mental illness at 10.01am and start drugging you straight away.\r\n\r\nDr Joanne Cacciatore, of Arizona State University, became a leading expert on the grief exception after her own baby, Cheyenne, died during childbirth. She had seen many grieving people being told that they were mentally ill for showing distress. She told me this debate reveals a key problem with how we talk about depression, anxiety and other forms of suffering: we don’t, she said, “consider context”. We act like human distress can be assessed solely on a checklist that can be separated out from our lives, and labelled as brain diseases. If we started to take people’s actual lives into account when we treat depression and anxiety, Joanne explained, it would require “an entire system overhaul”. She told me that when “you have a person with extreme human distress, [we need to] stop treating the symptoms. The symptoms are a messenger of a deeper problem. Let’s get to the deeper problem.\r\n\r\nI was a teenager when I swallowed my first antidepressant. I was standing in the weak English sunshine, outside a pharmacy in a shopping centre in London. The tablet was white and small, and as I swallowed, it felt like a chemical kiss. That morning I had gone to see my doctor and I had told him – crouched, embarrassed – that pain was leaking out of me uncontrollably, like a bad smell, and I had felt this way for several years. In reply, he told me a story. There is a chemical called serotonin that makes people feel good, he said, and some people are naturally lacking it in their brains. You are clearly one of those people. There are now, thankfully, new drugs that will restore your serotonin level to that of a normal person. Take them, and you will be well. At last, I understood what had been happening to me, and why.\r\n\r\nHowever, a few months into my drugging, something odd happened. The pain started to seep through again. Before long, I felt as bad as I had at the start. I went back to my doctor, and he told me that I was clearly on too low a dose. And so, 20 milligrams became 30 milligrams; the white pill became blue. I felt better for several months. And then the pain came back through once more. My dose kept being jacked up, until I was on 80mg, where it stayed for many years, with only a few short breaks. And still the pain broke back through.\r\n\r\nI started to research my book, Lost Connections: Uncovering The Real Causes of Depression – and the Unexpected Solutions, because I was puzzled by two mysteries. Why was I still depressed when I was doing everything I had been told to do? I had identified the low serotonin in my brain, and I was boosting my serotonin levels – yet I still felt awful. But there was a deeper mystery still. Why were so many other people across the western world feeling like me? Around one in five US adults are taking at least one drug for a psychiatric problem. In Britain, antidepressant prescriptions have doubled in a decade, to the point where now one in 11 of us drug ourselves to deal with these feelings. What has been causing depression and its twin, anxiety, to spiral in this way? I began to ask myself: could it really be that in our separate heads, all of us had brain chemistries that were spontaneously malfunctioning at the same time?\r\n\r\nTo find the answers, I ended up going on a 40,000-mile journey across the world and back. I talked to the leading social scientists investigating these questions, and to people who have been overcoming depression in unexpected ways – from an Amish village in Indiana, to a Brazilian city that banned advertising and a laboratory in Baltimore conducting a startling wave of experiments. From these people, I learned the best scientific evidence about what really causes depression and anxiety. They taught me that it is not what we have been told it is up to now. I found there is evidence that seven specific factors in the way we are living today are causing depression and anxiety to rise – alongside two real biological factors (such as your genes) that can combine with these forces to make it worse.\r\n\r\nOnce I learned this, I was able to see that a very different set of solutions to my depression – and to our depression – had been waiting for me all along.\r\n\r\nTo understand this different way of thinking, though, I had to first investigate the old story, the one that had given me so much relief at first. Professor Irving Kirsch at Harvard University is the Sherlock Holmes of chemical antidepressants – the man who has scrutinised the evidence about giving drugs to depressed and anxious people most closely in the world. In the 1990s, he prescribed chemical antidepressants to his patients with confidence. He knew the published scientific evidence, and it was clear: it showed that 70% of people who took them got significantly better. He began to investigate this further, and put in a freedom of information request to get the data that the drug companies had been privately gathering into these drugs. He was confident that he would find all sorts of other positive effects – but then he bumped into something peculiar.\r\n\r\nWe all know that when you take selfies, you take 30 pictures, throw away the 29 where you look bleary-eyed or double-chinned, and pick out the best one to be your Tinder profile picture. It turned out that the drug companies – who fund almost all the research into these drugs – were taking this approach to studying chemical antidepressants. They would fund huge numbers of studies, throw away all the ones that suggested the drugs had very limited effects, and then only release the ones that showed success. To give one example: in one trial, the drug was given to 245 patients, but the drug company published the results for only 27 of them. Those 27 patients happened to be the ones the drug seemed to work for. Suddenly, Professor Kirsch realised that the 70% figure couldn’t be right.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that between 65 and 80% of people on antidepressants are depressed again within a year. I had thought that I was freakish for remaining depressed while on these drugs. In fact, Kirsch explained to me in Massachusetts, I was totally typical. These drugs are having a positive effect for some people – but they clearly can’t be the main solution for the majority of us, because we’re still depressed even when we take them. At the moment, we offer depressed people a menu with only one option on it. I certainly don’t want to take anything off the menu – but I realised, as I spent time with him, that we would have to expand the menu.\r\n\r\nThis led Professor Kirsch to ask a more basic question, one he was surprised to be asking. How do we know depression is even caused by low serotonin at all? When he began to dig, it turned out that the evidence was strikingly shaky. Professor Andrew Scull of Princeton, writing in the Lancet, explained that attributing depression to spontaneously low serotonin is “deeply misleading and unscientific”. Dr David Healy told me: “There was never any basis for it, ever. It was just marketing copy.”\r\n\r\nI didn’t want to hear this. Once you settle into a story about your pain, you are extremely reluctant to challenge it. It was like a leash I had put on my distress to keep it under some control. I feared that if I messed with the story I had lived with for so long, the pain would run wild, like an unchained animal. Yet the scientific evidence was showing me something clear, and I couldn’t ignore it.\r\n\r\nSo, what is really going on? When I interviewed social scientists all over the world – from São Paulo to Sydney, from Los Angeles to London – I started to see an unexpected picture emerge. We all know that every human being has basic physical needs: for food, for water, for shelter, for clean air. It turns out that, in the same way, all humans have certain basic psychological needs. We need to feel we belong. We need to feel valued. We need to feel we’re good at something. We need to feel we have a secure future. And there is growing evidence that our culture isn’t meeting those psychological needs for many – perhaps most – people. I kept learning that, in very different ways, we have become disconnected from things we really need, and this deep disconnection is driving this epidemic of depression and anxiety all around us.\r\n\r\nLet’s look at one of those causes, and one of the solutions we can begin to see if we understand it differently. There is strong evidence that human beings need to feel their lives are meaningful – that they are doing something with purpose that makes a difference. It’s a natural psychological need. But between 2011 and 2012, the polling company Gallup conducted the most detailed study ever carried out of how people feel about the thing we spend most of our waking lives doing – our paid work. They found that 13% of people say they are “engaged” in their work – they find it meaningful and look forward to it. Some 63% say they are “not engaged”, which is defined as “sleepwalking through their workday”. And 24% are “actively disengaged”: they hate it.\r\n\r\nMost of the depressed and anxious people I know, I realised, are in the 87% who don’t like their work. I started to dig around to see if there is any evidence that this might be related to depression. It turned out that a breakthrough had been made in answering this question in the 1970s, by an Australian scientist called Michael Marmot. He wanted to investigate what causes stress in the workplace and believed he’d found the perfect lab in which to discover the answer: the British civil service, based in Whitehall. This small army of bureaucrats was divided into 19 different layers, from the permanent secretary at the top, down to the typists. What he wanted to know, at first, was: who’s more likely to have a stress-related heart attack – the big boss at the top, or somebody below him?\r\n\r\nEverybody told him: you’re wasting your time. Obviously, the boss is going to be more stressed because he’s got more responsibility. But when Marmot published his results, he revealed the truth to be the exact opposite. The lower an employee ranked in the hierarchy, the higher their stress levels and likelihood of having a heart attack. Now he wanted to know: why?\r\n\r\nAnd that’s when, after two more years studying civil servants, he discovered the biggest factor. It turns out if you have no control over your work, you are far more likely to become stressed – and, crucially, depressed. Humans have an innate need to feel that what we are doing, day-to-day, is meaningful. When you are controlled, you can’t create meaning out of your work.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the depression of many of my friends, even those in fancy jobs – who spend most of their waking hours feeling controlled and unappreciated – started to look not like a problem with their brains, but a problem with their environments. There are, I discovered, many causes of depression like this. However, my journey was not simply about finding the reasons why we feel so bad. The core was about finding out how we can feel better – how we can find real and lasting antidepressants that work for most of us, beyond only the packs of pills we have been offered as often the sole item on the menu for the depressed and anxious. I kept thinking about what Dr Cacciatore had taught me – we have to deal with the deeper problems that are causing all this distress.\r\n\r\nI found the beginnings of an answer to the epidemic of meaningless work – in Baltimore. Meredith Mitchell used to wake up every morning with her heart racing with anxiety. She dreaded her office job. So she took a bold step – one that lots of people thought was crazy. Her husband, Josh, and their friends had worked for years in a bike store, where they were ordered around and constantly felt insecure, Most of them were depressed. One day, they decided to set up their own bike store, but they wanted to run it differently. Instead of having one guy at the top giving orders, they would run it as a democratic co-operative. This meant they would make decisions collectively, they would share out the best and worst jobs and they would all, together, be the boss. It would be like a busy democratic tribe. When I went to their store – Baltimore Bicycle Works – the staff explained how, in this different environment, their persistent depression and anxiety had largely lifted.\r\n\r\nIt’s not that their individual tasks had changed much. They fixed bikes before; they fix bikes now. But they had dealt with the unmet psychological needs that were making them feel so bad – by giving themselves autonomy and control over their work. Josh had seen for himself that depressions are very often, as he put it, “rational reactions to the situation, not some kind of biological break”. He told me there is no need to run businesses anywhere in the old humiliating, depressing way – we could move together, as a culture, to workers controlling their own workplaces.\r\n\r\nWith each of the nine causes of depression and anxiety I learned about, I kept being taught startling facts and arguments like this that forced me to think differently. Professor John Cacioppo of the University of Chicago taught me that being acutely lonely is as stressful as being punched in the face by a stranger – and massively increases your risk of depression. Dr Vincent Felitti in San Diego showed me that surviving severe childhood trauma makes you 3,100% more likely to attempt suicide as an adult. Professor Michael Chandler in Vancouver explained to me that if a community feels it has no control over the big decisions affecting it, the suicide rate will shoot up.\r\n\r\nThis new evidence forces us to seek out a very different kind of solution to our despair crisis. One person in particular helped me to unlock how to think about this. In the early days of the 21st century, a South African psychiatrist named Derek Summerfeld went to Cambodia, at a time when antidepressants were first being introduced there. He began to explain the concept to the doctors he met. They listened patiently and then told him they didn’t need these new antidepressants, because they already had anti-depressants that work. He assumed they were talking about some kind of herbal remedy.\r\n\r\nHe asked them to explain, and they told him about a rice farmer they knew whose left leg was blown off by a landmine. He was fitted with a new limb, but he felt constantly anxious about the future, and was filled with despair. The doctors sat with him, and talked through his troubles. They realised that even with his new artificial limb, his old job—working in the rice paddies—was leaving him constantly stressed and in physical pain, and that was making him want to just stop living. So they had an idea. They believed that if he became a dairy farmer, he could live differently. So they bought him a cow. In the months and years that followed, his life changed. His depression—which had been profound—went away. “You see, doctor,” they told him, the cow was an “antidepressant”.\r\n\r\nTo them, finding an antidepressant didn’t mean finding a way to change your brain chemistry. It meant finding a way to solve the problem that was causing the depression in the first place. We can do the same. Some of these solutions are things we can do as individuals, in our private lives. Some require bigger social shifts, which we can only achieve together, as citizens. But all of them require us to change our understanding of what depression and anxiety really are.\r\n\r\nThis is radical, but it is not, I discovered, a maverick position. In its official statement for World Health Day in 2017, the United Nations reviewed the best evidence and concluded that “the dominant biomedical narrative of depression” is based on “biased and selective use of research outcomes” that “must be abandoned”. We need to move from “focusing on ‘chemical imbalances’”, they said, to focusing more on “power imbalances”.\r\n\r\nAfter I learned all this, and what it means for us all, I started to long for the power to go back in time and speak to my teenage self on the day he was told a story about his depression that was going to send him off in the wrong direction for so many years. I wanted to tell him: “This pain you are feeling is not a pathology. It’s not crazy. It is a signal that your natural psychological needs are not being met. It is a form of grief – for yourself, and for the culture you live in going so wrong. I know how much it hurts. I know how deeply it cuts you. But you need to listen to this signal. We all need to listen to the people around us sending out this signal. It is telling you what is going wrong. It is telling you that you need to be connected in so many deep and stirring ways that you aren’t yet – but you can be, one day.”\r\n\r\nIf you are depressed and anxious, you are not a machine with malfunctioning parts. You are a human being with unmet needs. The only real way out of our epidemic of despair is for all of us, together, to begin to meet those human needs – for deep connection, to the things that really matter in life.\r\n\r\n""]]"

However, you don’t need to join a gym or run five kilometers every day. Regular walks can be enough to improve your health and keep you fit. The health benefits of walking regularly are numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\nAside from improving your mental and cardiovascular health, as well as aiding in weight loss, walking regularly can just be a great way to get some fresh air into your lungs and get some much-needed vitamin D from direct sunlight. Even just getting out of your home and moving around can be enough to improve your mood and well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are eight benefits of walking that you may experience if you walk even just 30 minutes each day, you’ll start to experience improvements in your physical and mental health. Walking is recommended by the Mayo Clinic as a low impact exercise, and it is bound to benefit you in the following ways:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Improves mental health: One of the main benefits of walking is that it can improve your mood. According to the Mayo Clinic, walking can help improve symptoms of depression and anxiety.\r\n\r\n2. Effectively aids in weight loss: Researchers at Harvard Medical School found that walking regularly can reduce the effects of 32 obesity-promoting genes in the human body.\r\n\r\n3. Decreases the risk of certain cancers: Two studies from the American Society for Clinical Oncology showed that walking three hours a week can reduce the risk of dying from breast or bowel cancer by half\r\n\r\n4. Helps to boost your immune system: Walking at least 30 minutes a day was shown to increase the level of cells in the body’s immune system in a study done at Appalachian State University in North Carolina.\r\n\r\n5. Can be effective in preventing diabetes: The American Diabetes Association states that “aerobic exercise helps your body use insulin better,” and this can include a daily brisk walk after meals.\r\n\r\n6. Reduces cravings for sweets and the need for “stress eating”: Studies from the University of Exeter found that walking for just 15 minutes can help to curb cravings for sugary foods. It was also found to reduce cravings during stressful situations.\r\n\r\n7. Highly benefits cardiovascular health: One of the benefits of walking is promoting heart health. A study from the Harvard Medical School found that walking roughly 20 minutes a day can reduce the risk of heart disease by 30%\r\n\r\n8. Helps with mobility into advanced age: A study by the American Medical Association concluded that one of the greatest benefits of walking is that it promoted better physical health in people aged 70 to 89. Those who got regular exercise in their younger years dramatically decreased their chances of having any physical disability.""]]"

Amyloid plaques sit between the neurons and end up as dense clusters of beta-amyloid molecules, a sticky type of protein that clumps together and forms plaques. \r\n\r\nNeurofibrillary tangles are found inside the neurons of the brain, and they’re caused by defective tau proteins that clump up into a thick, insoluble mass. This causes tiny filaments called microtubules to get all twisted, which disrupts the transportation of essential materials such as nutrients and organelles along them, just like when you twist up the vacuum cleaner tube.\r\n\r\nAs we don’t have any kind of vaccine or preventative measure for Alzheimer’s - a disease that affects 343,000 people in Australia, and 50 million worldwide - it’s been a race to figure out how best to treat it, starting with how to clear the build-up of defective beta-amyloid and tau proteins from a patient’s brain. Now a team from the Queensland Brain Institute (QBI) at the University of Queensland have come up with a pretty promising solution for removing the former.\r\n\r\nPublishing in Science Translational Medicine, the team describes the technique as using a particular type of ultrasound called a focused therapeutic ultrasound, which non-invasively beams sound waves into the brain tissue.

It’s been found significantly less toxic than all the other substances on the list – including not only illegal drugs but the LEGAL alcohol and tobacco. Here’s our full report.\r\n\r\nClaims on marijuana’s medicinal values have been widely debated despite support from medical research and study. Federal legislations that govern marijuana use aim to restrict rather than regulate – and this has posed a problem to people seeking the medicinal and recreational effects of the herb, very far from intentions of abusing its effects. What is it about marijuana that scares the government – and the public – so much?\r\n\r\nMarijuana Use in the United States\r\n\r\nMarijuana, colloquially referred to as weed or pot, is made up of dried leaves and flowers of the hemp plant Cannabis sativa. Statistics released by the National Institute of Drug Abuse reveal that in respondents aged 18 to 25, more than half (exactly 51.90 percent) have used marijuana. Percentages are lower in the other two age groups, with 16.40 percent of respondents aged 12 to 17 and 45.70 percent of respondents aged 26 and older reporting marijuana use. [1]\r\n\r\nLaws in more than half the number of states in the US prohibit marijuana use, whether recreationally or medically. Currently (2015), only 21 states plus the District of Columbia have passed medical marijuana laws (MMLs) that recognize and permit the medicinal use of the herb. [2]\r\n\r\nNumerous studies have reported the positive medicinal effects of marijuana on pain, sleep, and overall comfort. A survey conducted by Trip, et. al. (2014) revealed that marijuana use was effective in improving mood, pain, muscle spasms, and sleep quality in patient with prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome. [3] The data collected from a more recent study in 2015 by Degenhardt, et. al. revealed that marijuana use in conjunction with prescribed opioids were able to induce effective pain relief in respondents experiencing chronic non-cancer pain. [4] These studies further support the popularity of marijuana use among people experiencing acute and chronic pain.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there have also been studies on the adverse effects of marijuana. One of these was published in mid-2014, focusing the negative health effects of smoking marijuana, particularly on the increased risk for lung cancer. [5] Of course, the study was only able to reveal how it was smoke (not cannabis itself) that damages lung tissue. This problem could easily be solved by changing the method in which marijuana is administered.\r\n\r\nRisk Assessment of Marijuana and Other Substances\r\n\r\nBut is marijuana use as dangerous as the law makes it out to be? The intoxicating effects of marijuana, although different, are not thought more severe than that of mild to moderate alcohol intake – a substance that is not illegal anywhere in the United States, or most countries all over the world. A study published in January 2015 by Lechenmeier and Rehm [6] assessed the comparative risk between different “mind-altering” substances, specifically alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and other illicit drugs like heroin. Surprisingly, the study revealed that cannabis was the least risky substance, belonging to the other end of the spectrum. Do you know what substance was revealed the most risky? Alcohol.\r\n\r\nHow is this possible? The study used an approach called the Margin of Exposure (MOE) which is drastically different from other studies that simply attempted to find causational relationship between two factors – (1) substance use/abuse and (2) mortality. MOE is different; it’s a ratio between the estimated (average) human intake and the benchmark dose (or toxicological threshold). Basically, it’s a ratio between how much humans typically intake and the dose at which the substance becomes dangerous – which is a better judge of how risky a substance can be. The higher the MOE is, the higher its spot on the list.\r\n\r\nThe results of the study were conclusive: The highest spot belonged to alcohol, while the succeeding spots were filled by heroin, cocaine, nicotine, MDMA, methamphetamine, methadone, amphetamine, diazepam, and THC (or marijuana). With marijuana in the lowest spot (over 100 times less toxic than alcohol), it can be surmised that its effects on health and society have been largely overestimated. If there was a plant that couldn’t be more misunderstood – or was it perhaps intentionally maligned – it has to be marijuana.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to note that the study measured toxic effects and does not consider any social effects of the use of the drug. However, this result is a clear indication that policies on marijuana are outdated and need re-evaluation – which is something that is gradually happening. It’s good news for the herband for the use of herbs in general.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1] National Institute of Drug Abuse (2014). Marijuana.

While you probably don’t consider them a health food, you may think they’re not that bad, or, at least, not as bad as eating a burger and fries or a fast-food burrito.\r\n\r\nIn a first-of-its-kind experiment, however, Dr. Braden Kuo of Massachusetts General Hospital may make you reconsider your love of instant noodles (assuming you have one).\r\n\r\nHe used a pill-sized camera to see what happens inside your stomach and digestive tract after you eat ramen noodles, one common type of instant noodles. The results were astonishing…\r\n\r\nRamen Noodles Don’t Break Down After Hours of Digestion\r\n\r\nIn the video above, you can see ramen noodles inside a stomach. Even after two hours, they are remarkably intact, much more so than the homemade ramen noodles, which were used as a comparison. This is concerning for a number of reasons.\r\n\r\nFor starters, it could be putting a strain on your digestive system, which is forced to work for hours to break down this highly processed food (ironically, most processed food is so devoid of fiber that it gets broken down very quickly, interfering with your blood sugar levels and insulin release).\r\n\r\nWhen food remains in your digestive tract for such a long time, it will also impact nutrient absorption, but, in the case of processed ramen noodles, there isn’t much nutrition to be had. Instead, there is a long list of additives, including the toxic preservative tertiary butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ).\r\n\r\nThis additive will likely remain in your stomach along with the seemingly invincible noodles, and no one knows what this extended exposure time may do to your health. Common sense suggests it’s not going to be good…\r\n\r\nFive Grams of Noodle Preservative, TBHQ, Is Lethal\r\nTBHQ, a byproduct of the petroleum industry, is often listed as an “antioxidant,” but it’s important to realize it is a synthetic chemical with antioxidant properties – not a natural antioxidant. The chemical prevents oxidation of fats and oils, thereby extending the shelf life of processed foods.\r\n\r\nIt’s a commonly used ingredient in processed foods of all kinds (including McDonald’s chicken nuggets, Kellogg’s CHEEZ-IT crackers, Reese’s peanut butter cups, Wheat Thins crackers, Teddy Grahams, Red Baron frozen pizza, Taco Bell beans, and much more).\r\n\r\nBut you can also find it in varnishes, lacquers, and pesticide products, as well as cosmetics and perfumes to reduce the evaporation rate and improve stability.\r\n\r\nAt its 19th and 21st meetings, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives determined that TBHQ was safe for human consumption at levels of 0-0.5 mg/kg of body weight.1\r\n\r\nHowever, the Codex commission set the maximum allowable limits up to between 100 to as much as 400 mg/kg, depending on the food it’s added to.2 (Chewing gum is permitted to contain the highest levels of TBHQ.) In the US, the Food and Drug Administration requires that TBHQ must not exceed 0.02 percent of its oil and fat content.3\r\n\r\nSo there’s quite a discrepancy in supposedly “safe” limits, but it’s probably best to have little or no exposure to this toxicant, as exposure to five grams can be lethal and, according to A Consumer’s Dictionary of Food Additives, exposure to just one gram of TBHQ can cause:4\r\n\r\nNausea and vomiting\r\nRinging in the ears (tinnitus)\r\nDelirium\r\nSense of suffocation\r\nCollapse\r\nWhile TBHQ is not suspected to be a persistent toxicant, meaning your body is probably able to eliminate it so that it does not bioaccumulate, if you eat instant noodles your body might be getting prolonged exposures. This is concerning, to say the least. According to the Environmental Working Group (EWG), based on animal studies health hazards associated with TBHQ include:5\r\n\r\nLiver effects at very low doses\r\nPositive mutation results from in vitro tests on mammalian cells\r\nBiochemical changes at very low doses\r\nReproductive effects at high doses\r\nEating Instant Noodles Linked to Metabolic Syndrome\r\nIf you’re still considering ramen noodles for lunch, you should know a new study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that women who consumed more instant noodles had a significantly greater risk of metabolic syndrome than those who ate less, regardless of their overall diet or exercise habits.6\r\n\r\nWomen who ate instant noodles more than twice a week were 68 percent more likely to have metabolic syndrome — a group of symptoms such as central obesity, elevated blood pressure, elevated fasting blood sugar, elevated fasting triglycerides, and low levels of HDL cholesterol.\r\n\r\nHaving three or more of the symptoms increases your risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Past research also analyzed overall nutrient intake between instant-noodle consumers and non-consumers, and found, as you might suspect, that eating instant noodles contributes little value to a healthy diet.\r\n\r\nThe instant noodle consumers had a significantly lower intake of important nutrients like protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, potassium, vitamin A, niacin, and vitamin C compared with non-consumers.7 Those who ate instant noodles also had an excessive intake of energy, unhealthy fats and sodium (just one package may contain 2,700 milligrams of sodium).8\r\n\r\nWhat Else Is in a Package of Instant Noodles?\r\nAside from a lot of sodium and the preservative TBHQ, what else is found in a typical serving of instant noodles?\r\n\r\nPrevent Disease reported:9\r\n\r\n“The dried noodle block was originally created by flash frying cooked noodles, and this is still the main method used in Asian countries, though air-dried noodle blocks are favored in Western countries. The main ingredients of the dried noodle are wheat flour, palm oil, and salt. Common ingredients of the flavoring powder are salt, monosodium glutamate, seasoning, and sugar.\r\n\r\nBenzopyrene\r\n…In June 2012, the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) found Benzopyrene (a cancer-causing substance) in six brands of noodles made by Nong Shim Company Ltd. Although the KFDA said the amounts were minuscule and not harmful, Nong Shim did identify particular batches of noodles with a problem, prompting a recall by October 2012.”\r\n\r\nMonosodium Glutamate (MSG)\r\nThe monosodium glutamate (MSG) in instant noodles is reason enough to avoid them. MSG is an excitotoxin, which means it overexcites your nerve cells to the point of damage or death, causing brain dysfunction and damage to varying degrees — and potentially even triggering or worsening learning disabilities, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Lou Gehrig’s disease, and more.\r\n\r\nGlutamic Acid\r\nPart of the problem is that free glutamic acid (MSG is approximately 78 percent free glutamic acid) is the same neurotransmitter that your brain, nervous system, eyes, pancreas, and other organs use to initiate certain processes in your body. Not to mention, MSG is also used to fatten up mice for scientific study. Yes, MSG is the perfect obesity drug. If you want to achieve your ideal body weight and health, avoid MSG at all costs.\r\n\r\nReturn to Whole, Living Foods for Optimal Health\r\nOccasionally eating a package of instant noodles clearly won’t kill you, but when you make a habit of substituting convenience foods for real food, it’s only a matter of time before health problems will likely develop.\r\n\r\nInstant noodles are a prime example of the types of processed foods you want to avoid as much as possible, as they are virtually guaranteed to make you sick and fat if you indulge too much (and “too much” may be as little as a couple of times a week).\r\n\r\nProcessed foods encourage weight gain and chronic disease because they’re high in sugar, fructose, refined carbohydrates, and artificial ingredients, and low in nutrients and fiber. Processed foods are addictive and designed to make you overeat; they also encourage excessive food cravings, leading to weight gain.\r\n\r\nEating processed foods also promotes insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, which are hallmarks of most chronic and/or serious diseases. On the other hand, people have thrived on vegetables, meats, eggs, fruits, and other whole foods for centuries, while processed foods were only recently invented.\r\n\r\nDitching processed foods requires that you plan your meals in advance, but if you take it step-by-step as described in my nutrition plan, it’s quite possible, and manageable, to painlessly remove processed foods from your diet.\r\n\r\nYou can try scouting out your local farmer’s markets for in-season produce that is priced to sell, and planning your meals accordingly, but you can also use this same premise with supermarket sales.\r\n\r\nYou can generally plan a week of meals at a time, making sure you have all ingredients necessary on hand, and then do any prep work you can ahead of time so that dinner is easy to prepare if you’re short on time (and you can use leftovers for lunches the next day, so you don’t have to resort to instant noodles).\r\n\r\nHere are 7 Ways To Avoid Processed Foods!\r\n\r\nAnd if ramen noodles are a staple in your house and you can’t see yourself giving them up try something like these healthy options:\r\n\r\nLotus Foods Gluten Free Rice Ramen\r\n\r\nGluten Free Asian Noodle Cups\r\n\r\nVegan Organic Noodle Ramen""]]"
