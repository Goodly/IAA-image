But I would always have it happen at Mar-a-Lago, which my family owns.

Because the government doesn\u2019t just let you withdraw the money, you know? New York especially gets really annoying about that. But the best part is that, since it was my charity, I could charge it whatever I wanted to stay at Mar-a-Lago!
