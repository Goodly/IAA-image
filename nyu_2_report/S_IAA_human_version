Like, my cancer charity that I was running had a big annual dinner where I’d give myself an award for philanthropy every year, and we’d have a silent auction and do all kinds of fun things like that. But I would always have it happen at Mar-a-Lago, which my family owns. My dad would give me a commission for booking the charity events there, and that was just one of the many ways we figured out how to funnel those charitable donations we were collecting all year into our personal accounts. Because the government doesn’t just let you withdraw the money, you know? New York especially gets really annoying about that. But the best part is that, since it was my charity, I could charge it whatever I wanted to stay at Mar-a-Lago! I would charge double the reservation fees, double the cost per plate for the dinner, and I’d even take the servers’ tips and the bartenders’ tips for a little extra cash. Always do cash when you can, that’s an insider’s tip from me to you. The best part about cash transactions is you don’t have to claim it on your taxes! The government doesn’t have to know, ya feel me? Man, I made so much money off my cancer charity that it shouldn’t have been legal! Well, technically it wasn’t, and now I can’t do it for ten years, but, boy, when this decade is up and I can go back to booking charity events at my family’s properties, I’m gonna make so much money again!
