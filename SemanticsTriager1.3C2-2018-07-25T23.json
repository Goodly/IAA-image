"batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "text": "title: Some blame the economy for rise in highway deaths\n\nAuthor:  Susan Scutti\n\nDate: Wed February 15, 2017\n\nFor the first time in a decade, more than 40,000 people died on US roadways last year, according to estimates reported by the National Safety Council.\n\nOverall, highway deaths increased 6% over 2015 and 14% over 2014. This is the sharpest two-year rise since 1964, says the council, a nonprofit focused on eliminating preventable deaths.\n\nThe worst month in 2016 was October, which contributed 3,790 to the total 40,200 highway deaths, according to the report. January saw the lowest number, with 2,740 deaths.\n\nAs might be expected due to the overall population of certain individual states, Texas, California and Florida each had more than 3,000 deaths in 2016.\nAlaska, Vermont, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia had the least, with fewer than 100 deaths each.\n\nOverall, the researchers estimated 12.4 deaths per 100,000 people in 2016, a 5% increase over the 2015 rate. They also estimate about 4.6 million motor-vehicle injuries required a medical consultation in 2016, an increase of 7% from 2015.\nFigures from 2014 and 2015 were gathered from the National Center for Health Statistics, but estimates for 2016 are still considered a preliminary tally, compiled by the safety council from each state's traffic authorities.\n\nMore drivers on the road\n\n\"During the recession, the number of deaths on our roadways went down a lot. We were driving less,\" said Ken Kolosh, manager of statistics at the National Safety Council. Traffic deaths dropped during the years 2008 through 2010, with a very slow increase then taking place until 2015.\n\nThese days, gas prices are lower and job growth is better, so people are traveling more often. For 2016, the council estimated a 3% increase in motor-vehicle mileage over the previous year, however, this increase in traffic, unfortunately, also leads to a swelling number of highway fatalities.\n\nHowever, a 3% increase in miles driven versus a 6% increase in deaths suggests something else is at play.\n\nKolosh saw evidence that \"teenagers and young drivers were impacted and lost access to vehicles during the recession.\" With the economy improving, teens are back on the highways, he said.\n\n\"We see actually a decrease in drivers talking on their phones -- either handheld or hands-free -- but increasingly, we're seeing drivers texting or doing other activities on their phones,\" Kolosh said. Not surprisingly, he points to \"our younger drivers, the 15- to 24-year-olds\" as most responsible for this shift.\n\n\"At any given daylight moment, nearly 5% of them are likely texting or doing something else on their phones while behind the wheel,\" he said. \"We're also seeing a very, very large increase in the number of vulnerable road users who are dying on our roads.\"\n\nVulnerable road users include pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists.\nThough it's known that distracted driving is on the rise, \"the role of the distracted pedestrian\" may be an understudied problem, according to Kolosh, who cites a 9% increase in the number of pedestrian deaths on the road between 2015 and 2016.\n\"We are pretty sure there's more distracted pedestrians in our towns, on our sidewalks, than ever before, and that's probably increasing,\" he said. Although aware that it's not safe to text while driving, pedestrians think nothing of doing so while walking, said Kolosh.\n\n'Booze, belts and speed'\n\nAccording to Kara Macek, senior director of communications and programs at the Governors Highway Safety Association, road death numbers \"often fluctuate a bit year-to-year.\" However, \"this is definitely a troubling new trend, and it's difficult to pinpoint one precise cause.\"\n\nThe association is a nonprofit representing state and territorial highway safety offices. Macek was not involved in the new safety report.\n\nMacek also points to the growing economy, which has resulted in more people driving more often. She further attributes the increasing deaths to a rise in \"our growing appetite for connectivity, which leads drivers to dangerous distractions,\" but believes the core reasons have not changed that much.\n\n\"What's killing people on the road? It's still booze, belts and speed,\" said Macek, who noted that in 2015, alcohol and speed were factors in 28% and 27% of fatalities, while 48% of those killed in car crashes were not buckled up.\n\nJessica Cicchino, vice president of research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent scientific and educational organization, also believes economic recovery is the main factor behind the recent increase in deaths.\n\n\"It's not just that Americans drive more miles when the economy improves. It's the kind of miles they drive,\" said Cicchino, who did not contribute to the new report. \"What comes back after a recession is the optional driving that's riskier, like going out on the weekends or taking long trips on unfamiliar roads.\"\n\nBecause she didn't see \"a spike in cell phone use cited as a factor in fatal crashes,\" Cicchino is less likely to blame distracted driving. However, she said, \"teens, the age group with the highest fatal crash rates per mile driven, are back on the road after the recession.\"\n\nIn addition, many states may be implementing policies that counter highway safety, according to Cicchino.\n\n\"In the last three years alone, 13 states have raised speed limits on at least some portion of their interstates,\" she said: Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nOf these states, five states -- Maryland, Montana, South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming -- showed a diminished number of highway deaths, however the majority showed increases, suggesting her theory is mainly correct.\n\nOf all the states, Wyoming had the most improved rate, with a 25% decrease in roadway fatalities over the past two years, from 149 deaths in 2014 to 112 in 2016.\n\nWyoming, the model state\n\nLt. David Wagener of the Wyoming Highway Patrol finds it difficult to pinpoint the reason why his state is leading the nation in decreased highway fatalities.\n\"There was some slowdown in coal and other natural resource industries in Wyoming in 2016, so there were less people on the highways because of that, and there was less traffic moving, so that's one reason,\" he said.\n\"But really,\" he said, \"it comes down to the individual making good decisions before they get behind the wheel and good decisions when they are driving.\"\nThose good decisions include \"making sure they get enough sleep, making sure they're not driving impaired, making sure they're wearing seat belts, making sure children in the vehicle are buckled in or wearing child restraints.\"\nHis unofficial numbers match up with the estimates from the Safety Council.\n\"According to the spreadsheet I have, 55 of those 112 fatalities had a seat belt available in the vehicle they were in, yet they chose not to wear it at the time of the crash,\" Wagener said.\n\"We have 34 listed as alcohol-related,\" he added. Wyoming also counted 24 deaths among motorcyclists -- 39 rollover-related, nine weather-related -- and three deaths among ATV drivers.\n\nHighway Patrol Sgt. Dwayne Ellis credits the \"Alive at 25\" program for significantly reducing the number of crashes and deaths in his state.\n\"We've taught well over 6,000 kids since the (program's) inception in late 2008, and of those, we've been able to identify only six who have died in a crash either as a driver or passenger before their 25th birthday,\" said Ellis, who is the state's safety education coordinator.\nThough he was not able to provide numbers from 2007 to show the difference, he knows the program is extremely successful in part through feedback from both parents and young adults.\n\"What it does is, it talks about choice-making and consequences and how the choices that they make while driving not only affect them but affect everyone around them and everybody they know,\" Ellis said. \"We empower them to think about the consequences and make good choices and let them know they are in control of their life -- it's whether they want to take control.\"\nThe class, part of a national program, is given in schools as part of the drivers education curriculum or can be taken on a volunteer basis or as an insurance deduction. Some people who have received a citation for speeding may be required by the court to take the class.\nWyoming starts them young, beginning with safety lessons in kindergarten via the \"Little Convincer.\" This stationary platform used in presentations demonstrates how teddy bears not buckled into their seats will fall out during a crash. Then, the kids themselves can buckle themselves into the seat.\nThe adult version of the \"convincer\" uses a rollover machine and unrestrained dummies who are ejected, flying through the air, when they're not properly buckled into place.\n\nBack on the national level, Kolosh believes the US is still doing better overall than in the past.\n\"The number of deaths on our roadways really peaked in the 1970s,\" he said. Back then, \"a lot of the safety advances that we've all become quite accustomed to\" had not yet taken place,\" he noted.\n\nAt that time, the US did not have strong DUI laws or a lot of safety advances (such as airbags) in vehicles. The nation also did not have graduated programs to ease teenagers into becoming full-fledged licensed drivers.\n\n\"Our roads are much safer than they were in the '70s,\" Kolosh said.\n", "metadata": {"article_number": "1730", "filename": "1730SSSArticle.txt"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 143, "uuid": "3dce0161-cddc-4d1c-8c01-94925005720b", "generator": {"id": 28, "uuid": "2c0af7d1-921b-4b31-bcd6-a825c038e61b", "name": "FormTriager1.1C2", "task_config": {"contributor_id": null, "redundancy": 17, "batchname_regex": "SSSPETest2", "topic_ids": [39, 47, 35]}, "task_type": "HLTR"}, "article_id": 77, "info": {"article": {"article_number": 1730, "text": "title: Some blame the economy for rise in highway deaths\n\nAuthor:  Susan Scutti\n\nDate: Wed February 15, 2017\n\nFor the first time in a decade, more than 40,000 people died on US roadways last year, according to estimates reported by the National Safety Council.\n\nOverall, highway deaths increased 6% over 2015 and 14% over 2014.

David Wagener of the Wyoming Highway Patrol finds it difficult to pinpoint the reason why his state is leading the nation in decreased highway fatalities.\n\"There was some slowdown in coal and other natural resource industries in Wyoming in 2016, so there were less people on the highways because of that, and there was less traffic moving, so that's one reason,\" he said.\n\"But really,\" he said, \"it comes down to the individual making good decisions before they get behind the wheel and good decisions when they are driving.\"\nThose good decisions include \"making sure they get enough sleep, making sure they're not driving impaired, making sure they're wearing seat belts, making sure children in the vehicle are buckled in or wearing child restraints.\"\nHis unofficial numbers match up with the estimates from the Safety Council.\n\"According to the spreadsheet I have, 55 of those 112 fatalities had a seat belt available in the vehicle they were in, yet they chose not to wear it at the time of the crash,\" Wagener said.\n\"We have 34 listed as alcohol-related,\" he added. Wyoming also counted 24 deaths among motorcyclists -- 39 rollover-related, nine weather-related -- and three deaths among ATV drivers.\n\nHighway Patrol Sgt. Dwayne Ellis credits the \"Alive at 25\" program for significantly reducing the number of crashes and deaths in his state.\n\"We've taught well over 6,000 kids since the (program's) inception in late 2008, and of those, we've been able to identify only six who have died in a crash either as a driver or passenger before their 25th birthday,\" said Ellis, who is the state's safety education coordinator.\nThough he was not able to provide numbers from 2007 to show the difference, he knows the program is extremely successful in part through feedback from both parents and young adults.\n\"What it does is, it talks about choice-making and consequences and how the choices that they make while driving not only affect them but affect everyone around them and everybody they know,\" Ellis said. \"We empower them to think about the consequences and make good choices and let them know they are in control of their life -- it's whether they want to take control.\"\nThe class, part of a national program, is given in schools as part of the drivers education curriculum or can be taken on a volunteer basis or as an insurance deduction. Some people who have received a citation for speeding may be required by the court to take the class.\nWyoming starts them young, beginning with safety lessons in kindergarten via the \"Little Convincer.\" This stationary platform used in presentations demonstrates how teddy bears not buckled into their seats will fall out during a crash. Then, the kids themselves can buckle themselves into the seat.\nThe adult version of the \"convincer\" uses a rollover machine and unrestrained dummies who are ejected, flying through the air, when they're not properly buckled into place.\n\nBack on the national level, Kolosh believes the US is still doing better overall than in the past.\n\"The number of deaths on our roadways really peaked in the 1970s,\" he said. Back then, \"a lot of the safety advances that we've all become quite accustomed to\" had not yet taken place,\" he noted.\n\nAt that time, the US did not have strong DUI laws or a lot of safety advances (such as airbags) in vehicles. The nation also did not have graduated programs to ease teenagers into becoming full-fledged licensed drivers.\n\n\"Our roads are much safer than they were in the '70s,\" Kolosh said.\n", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1730:71c35502-7498-49b0-8e76-ad974ca60198", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "2d6de61b16c3ade370a26e2c410c884184c1272615b2be897518a54592c00cfd", "id": 77, "metadata": {"article_number": "1730", "filename": "1730SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "0ab01231-2f3c-40a4-b791-ed0fa65208ab", "topic_number": 0, "glossary": {}, "name": "Quoted Sources", "instructions": "Use the 'Quoted Sources' label to highlight BOTH the names of anyone (person or organization) quoted or paraphrased in the article AND the quote or paraphrase itself.

Dwayne Ellis credits the \"Alive at 25\" program for significantly reducing the number of crashes and deaths in his state.\n\"We've taught well over 6,000 kids since the (program's) inception in late 2008, and of those, we've been able to identify only six who have died in a crash either as a driver or passenger before their 25th birthday,\" said Ellis, who is the state's safety education coordinator.\nThough he was not able to provide numbers from 2007 to show the difference, he knows the program is extremely successful in part through feedback from both parents and young adults.\n\"What it does is, it talks about choice-making and consequences and how the choices that they make while driving not only affect them but affect everyone around them and everybody they know,\" Ellis said. \"We empower them to think about the consequences and make good choices and let them know they are in control of their life -- it's whether they want to take control.\"\nThe class, part of a national program, is given in schools as part of the drivers education curriculum or can be taken on a volunteer basis or as an insurance deduction.

Then, the kids themselves can buckle themselves into the seat.\nThe adult version of the \"convincer\" uses a rollover machine and unrestrained dummies who are ejected, flying through the air, when they're not properly buckled into place.\n\nBack on the national level, Kolosh believes the US is still doing better overall than in the past.\n\"The number of deaths on our roadways really peaked in the 1970s,\" he said.

This is the sharpest two-year rise since 1964, says the council, a nonprofit focused on eliminating preventable deaths.\n\nThe worst month in 2016 was October, which contributed 3,790 to the total 40,200 highway deaths, according to the report. January saw the lowest number, with 2,740 deaths.\n\nAs might be expected due to the overall population of certain individual states, Texas, California and Florida each had more than 3,000 deaths in 2016.\nAlaska, Vermont, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia had the least, with fewer than 100 deaths each.\n\nOverall, the researchers estimated 12.4 deaths per 100,000 people in 2016, a 5% increase over the 2015 rate. They also estimate about 4.6 million motor-vehicle injuries required a medical consultation in 2016, an increase of 7% from 2015.\nFigures from 2014 and 2015 were gathered from the National Center for Health Statistics, but estimates for 2016 are still considered a preliminary tally, compiled by the safety council from each state's traffic authorities.\n\nMore drivers on the road\n\n\"During the recession, the number of deaths on our roadways went down a lot. We were driving less,\" said Ken Kolosh, manager of statistics at the National Safety Council. Traffic deaths dropped during the years 2008 through 2010, with a very slow increase then taking place until 2015.\n\nThese days, gas prices are lower and job growth is better, so people are traveling more often. For 2016, the council estimated a 3% increase in motor-vehicle mileage over the previous year, however, this increase in traffic, unfortunately, also leads to a swelling number of highway fatalities.\n\nHowever, a 3% increase in miles driven versus a 6% increase in deaths suggests something else is at play.\n\nKolosh saw evidence that \"teenagers and young drivers were impacted and lost access to vehicles during the recession.\" With the economy improving, teens are back on the highways, he said.\n\n\"We see actually a decrease in drivers talking on their phones -- either handheld or hands-free -- but increasingly, we're seeing drivers texting or doing other activities on their phones,\" Kolosh said. Not surprisingly, he points to \"our younger drivers, the 15- to 24-year-olds\" as most responsible for this shift.\n\n\"At any given daylight moment, nearly 5% of them are likely texting or doing something else on their phones while behind the wheel,\" he said. \"We're also seeing a very, very large increase in the number of vulnerable road users who are dying on our roads.\"\n\nVulnerable road users include pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists.\nThough it's known that distracted driving is on the rise, \"the role of the distracted pedestrian\" may be an understudied problem, according to Kolosh, who cites a 9% increase in the number of pedestrian deaths on the road between 2015 and 2016.\n\"We are pretty sure there's more distracted pedestrians in our towns, on our sidewalks, than ever before, and that's probably increasing,\" he said. Although aware that it's not safe to text while driving, pedestrians think nothing of doing so while walking, said Kolosh.\n\n'Booze, belts and speed'\n\nAccording to Kara Macek, senior director of communications and programs at the Governors Highway Safety Association, road death numbers \"often fluctuate a bit year-to-year.\" However, \"this is definitely a troubling new trend, and it's difficult to pinpoint one precise cause.\"\n\nThe association is a nonprofit representing state and territorial highway safety offices. Macek was not involved in the new safety report.\n\nMacek also points to the growing economy, which has resulted in more people driving more often. She further attributes the increasing deaths to a rise in \"our growing appetite for connectivity, which leads drivers to dangerous distractions,\" but believes the core reasons have not changed that much.\n\n\"What's killing people on the road? It's still booze, belts and speed,\" said Macek, who noted that in 2015, alcohol and speed were factors in 28% and 27% of fatalities, while 48% of those killed in car crashes were not buckled up.\n\nJessica Cicchino, vice president of research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent scientific and educational organization, also believes economic recovery is the main factor behind the recent increase in deaths.\n\n\"It's not just that Americans drive more miles when the economy improves. It's the kind of miles they drive,\" said Cicchino, who did not contribute to the new report. \"What comes back after a recession is the optional driving that's riskier, like going out on the weekends or taking long trips on unfamiliar roads.\"\n\nBecause she didn't see \"a spike in cell phone use cited as a factor in fatal crashes,\" Cicchino is less likely to blame distracted driving. However, she said, \"teens, the age group with the highest fatal crash rates per mile driven, are back on the road after the recession.\"\n\nIn addition, many states may be implementing policies that counter highway safety, according to Cicchino.\n\n\"In the last three years alone, 13 states have raised speed limits on at least some portion of their interstates,\" she said: Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nOf these states, five states -- Maryland, Montana, South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming -- showed a diminished number of highway deaths, however the majority showed increases, suggesting her theory is mainly correct.\n\nOf all the states, Wyoming had the most improved rate, with a 25% decrease in roadway fatalities over the past two years, from 149 deaths in 2014 to 112 in 2016.\n\nWyoming, the model state\n\nLt.

Then, the kids themselves can buckle themselves into the seat.\nThe adult version of the \"convincer\" uses a rollover machine and unrestrained dummies who are ejected, flying through the air, when they're not properly buckled into place.\n\nBack on the national level, Kolosh believes the US is still doing better overall than in the past.\n\"The number of deaths on our roadways really peaked in the 1970s,\" he said. Back then, \"a lot of the safety advances that we've all become quite accustomed to\" had not yet taken place,\" he noted.\n\nAt that time, the US did not have strong DUI laws or a lot of safety advances (such as airbags) in vehicles. The nation also did not have graduated programs to ease teenagers into becoming full-fledged licensed drivers.\n\n\"Our roads are much safer than they were in the '70s,\" Kolosh said.\n", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1730:71c35502-7498-49b0-8e76-ad974ca60198", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "2d6de61b16c3ade370a26e2c410c884184c1272615b2be897518a54592c00cfd", "id": 77, "metadata": {"article_number": "1730", "filename": "1730SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "dd6978d0-e168-4599-b8c1-b0fc72585eb5", "topic_number": 2, "glossary": {}, "name": "Language", "instructions": "Use the \u2018Language\u2019 label to highlight for issues of tone and typos.

Seems simple enough! Yet those gaudy numbers are harder to explain when you look closely at another set of numbers: The Spurs are often nowhere to be found when opposing teams take corner 3\u2019s. Last year, according to data compiled by SportVU client manager Matt Scott at FiveThirtyEight\u2019s request, the Spurs contested 35 percent of corner 3\u2019s, seventh-lowest in the league; this year, they\u2019re third from the bottom with a similar rate.\n\n[Graph: The Spurs defense: Better lucky than good?

Credit Jennifer Sens for The New York Times\nDuring her pregnancy, she never drank alcohol or had a cigarette. But nearly every day, Stacey, then 24, smoked marijuana.\n\nWith her fianc\u00e9\u2019s blessing, she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell morning sickness before going to work at a sandwich shop. When sciatica made it unbearable to stand during her 12-hour shifts, she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily say, \u2018Go smoke a pound of pot when you\u2019re pregnant,\u2019\u201d said Stacey, now a stay-at-home mother in Deltona, Fla., who asked that her full name be withheld because street-bought marijuana is illegal in Florida. \u201cIn moderation, it\u2019s O.K.\u201d\n\nMany pregnant women, particularly younger ones, seem to agree, a recent federal survey shows. As states legalize marijuana or its medical use, expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers \u2014 another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health.\n\nA Balm When You\u2019re Expecting: Sometimes Pot Does the Trick FEB. 20, 2017\n\nPET CITY\nDogs on Marijuana: Not Cool FEB. 2, 2017\n\nPets on Pot: The Newest Customer Base for Medical Marijuana OCT. 8, 2016\n\nCalifornians Legalize Marijuana in Vote That Could Echo Nationally NOV. 9, 2016\n\nD.E.A. Keeps Marijuana on List of Dangerous Drugs, Frustrating Advocates AUG. 11, 2016\nAdvertisement\n\nOften pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants. But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana\u2019s main psychoactive ingredient \u2014 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC \u2014 can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk.\n\n\u201cThere is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it\u2019s actually safe,\u201d said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use.\n\nIn the federal survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of mothers-to-be said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2.4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.)\n\n[Photo]\n\nStacey\u2019s son just had his first birthday. He\u2019s walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn\u2019t worried about his development. Credit Jennifer Sens for The New York Times\nYoung mothers-to-be were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7.5 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44.\n\nEvidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, 6-year-olds born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention.\n\nMost troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers.\n\n\u201cPrenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,\u201d said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nSeveral studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion.\n\n\u201cEven early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,\u201d said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. \u201cThose are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition.\u201d\n\nIt is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even eventually reducing I.Q.\n\n\u201cThe effects are not dramatic, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are not important,\u201d said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. \u201cIt could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,\u201d she added.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement. But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic.\n\nOf five federal agencies, only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February, according to a study published online in December in the journal Substance Abuse. Only 10 state health departments did.\n\nUntil recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered nothing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think public health officials should be alarming people,\u201d said Marian Jarlenski, the study\u2019s lead author and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. \u201cThey just have to say, \u2018There have been studies done, and there is some risk.\u2019\u201d\n\nGet the best of Well, with the latest on health, fitness and nutrition, delivered to your inbox every week.\n\nYou agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.\n\nSEE SAMPLE PRIVACY POLICY OPT OUT OR CONTACT US ANYTIME\nIn a statement, C.D.C. officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to THC in utero.\n\n\u201cWhile current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent, some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy, such as low birth weight or preterm birth,\u201d the agency said.\n\nDr. Marie McCormick, a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new report on cannabis from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, said smoking cannabis \u201cdoes confer, in terms of birth weight, the same risk as cigarettes.\u201d\n\nSome of the gathering evidence is reassuring. So far, prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious birth defects. \u201cThat\u2019s why some providers and lay people alike think there\u2019s no effect,\u201d said Dr. Erica Wymore, a neonatologist at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado. But she warned, \u201cJust because they don\u2019t have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn\u2019t mean the baby\u2019s neurological development is not impacted.\u201d\n\nMost research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent. Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n\u201cAll those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren\u2019t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,\u201d said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington\u2019s fetal alcohol and drug unit. \u201cWe need to do a whole lot more research now.\u201d\n\nThere are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use. Research is often based on reports by pregnant women \u2014 instead of, say, tests of urine or the umbilical cord \u2014 and they consistently underreport their use.

But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana\u2019s main psychoactive ingredient \u2014 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC \u2014 can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk.\n\n\u201cThere is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it\u2019s actually safe,\u201d said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use.\n\nIn the federal survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of mothers-to-be said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2.4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.)\n\n[Photo]\n\nStacey\u2019s son just had his first birthday.

Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, 6-year-olds born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention.\n\nMost troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers.\n\n\u201cPrenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,\u201d said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nSeveral studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion.\n\n\u201cEven early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,\u201d said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. \u201cThose are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition.\u201d\n\nIt is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even eventually reducing I.Q.\n\n\u201cThe effects are not dramatic, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are not important,\u201d said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. \u201cIt could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,\u201d she added.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement. But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic.\n\nOf five federal agencies, only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February, according to a study published online in December in the journal Substance Abuse.

But she warned, \u201cJust because they don\u2019t have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn\u2019t mean the baby\u2019s neurological development is not impacted.\u201d\n\nMost research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent. Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n\u201cAll those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren\u2019t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,\u201d said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington\u2019s fetal alcohol and drug unit. \u201cWe need to do a whole lot more research now.\u201d\n\nThere are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use.

But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana\u2019s main psychoactive ingredient \u2014 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC \u2014 can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight.

Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use.\n\nIn the federal survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of mothers-to-be said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2.4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.)\n\n[Photo]\n\nStacey\u2019s son just had his first birthday.

Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, 6-year-olds born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention.\n\nMost troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers.\n\n\u201cPrenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,\u201d said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nSeveral studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion.\n\n\u201cEven early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,\u201d said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. \u201cThose are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition.\u201d\n\nIt is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even eventually reducing I.Q.\n\n\u201cThe effects are not dramatic, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are not important,\u201d said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. \u201cIt could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,\u201d she added.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement. But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic.\n\nOf five federal agencies, only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February, according to a study published online in December in the journal Substance Abuse. Only 10 state health departments did.\n\nUntil recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered nothing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think public health officials should be alarming people,\u201d said Marian Jarlenski, the study\u2019s lead author and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. \u201cThey just have to say, \u2018There have been studies done, and there is some risk.\u2019\u201d\n\nGet the best of Well, with the latest on health, fitness and nutrition, delivered to your inbox every week.\n\nYou agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.\n\nSEE SAMPLE PRIVACY POLICY OPT OUT OR CONTACT US ANYTIME\nIn a statement, C.D.C. officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to THC in utero.\n\n\u201cWhile current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent, some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy, such as low birth weight or preterm birth,\u201d the agency said.\n\nDr. Marie McCormick, a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new report on cannabis from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, said smoking cannabis \u201cdoes confer, in terms of birth weight, the same risk as cigarettes.\u201d\n\nSome of the gathering evidence is reassuring. So far, prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious birth defects. \u201cThat\u2019s why some providers and lay people alike think there\u2019s no effect,\u201d said Dr. Erica Wymore, a neonatologist at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado. But she warned, \u201cJust because they don\u2019t have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn\u2019t mean the baby\u2019s neurological development is not impacted.\u201d\n\nMost research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent. Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n\u201cAll those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren\u2019t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,\u201d said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington\u2019s fetal alcohol and drug unit. \u201cWe need to do a whole lot more research now.\u201d\n\nThere are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use. Research is often based on reports by pregnant women \u2014 instead of, say, tests of urine or the umbilical cord \u2014 and they consistently underreport their use. (Researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies.) And pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol; it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself.\n\nFew realize that THC is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother\u2019s body for weeks, if not months. It\u2019s not known whether the fetus\u2019s exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit.\n\nTo find out whether that\u2019s happening, Dr. Judy Chang, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients.\n\nMedical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana, the researchers found, than to advise them of potential risks. When mothers-to-be admitted to marijuana use, almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all.\n\nPregnant women aren\u2019t eager to discuss it, either, because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture.\n\nDepression, anxiety, stress, pain, nausea and vomiting were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 survey of low-income mothers getting federal nutrition help in Colorado. Roughly 6 percent were pot users; a third were pregnant.\n\n\u201cWomen are thinking of this as medical marijuana in that they are treating some condition,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute who researches substance abuse in pregnancy.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to consider it like medicine,\u201d she said, \u201cthen treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it.\u201d\n\nStacey\u2019s son just had his first birthday. He\u2019s walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn\u2019t worried about his development.\n\nShe still smokes pot \u2014 indeed, her son plays on a rug emblazoned with a marijuana leaf. But the severe cramps that plagued her before pregnancy are easing now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to smoke as much anymore,\u201d she said.", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1739:5b14d080-cbf5-4700-919f-b1bc740828ac", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "a6a4d058630efccca1ce1f7e636ca8f3e392460db4e62c2280617edc9b209be0", "id": 86, "metadata": {"article_number": "1739", "filename": "1739SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "09ddb788-c3a6-44e5-a8c2-b6591d4a1f13", "topic_number": 0, "glossary": {}, "name": "Reasoning", "instructions": "Use the \u2018Reasoning\u2019 label on phrases and sentences that include specific and identifiable cognitive biases, psychological biases, argumentative fallacies, or logical errors.

But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana\u2019s main psychoactive ingredient \u2014 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC \u2014 can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk.\n\n\u201cThere is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it\u2019s actually safe,\u201d said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use.\n\nIn the federal survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of mothers-to-be said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2.4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.)\n\n[Photo]\n\nStacey\u2019s son just had his first birthday.

Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, 6-year-olds born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention.\n\nMost troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers.\n\n\u201cPrenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,\u201d said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nSeveral studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use.

Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\n\nCleveland Cavaliers basketball star Kyrie Irving has apparently joined the dubious celebrity ranks of former The View host Sherri Shepherd, rapper B.o.B., and reality TV personality Tila Tequila by coming out in public to declare that the world is flat.\n\nIn a recent podcast leading up to the 2017 NBA All-Star Weekend, Irving said:\n\n\u201cFor what I\u2019ve known for many years and what I\u2019ve been taught is that the Earth is round, but if you really think about it from a landscape of the way we travel, the way we move and the fact that \u2014 can you really think of us rotating around the sun, and all planets align, rotating in specific dates, being perpendicular with what\u2019s going on with these planets and stuff like this.\u201d\n\nWith this quotation, Deadspin magazine ran the headline, \u201cKyrie Irving Really, Actually, Earnestly Believes The Earth Is Flat.\u201d\n\nBut does Irving, who spent his freshman year at Duke University before leaving for professional basketball, really, actually, and earnestly believe the earth is flat? Does anyone?\n\nWhile it\u2019s often said that human beings believed that the Earth was flat through the Middle Ages until Christopher Columbus set us straight in 1492, a more historically accurate account tells us that civilization had abandoned flat Earth theories at least a century before that. Educated people have therefore accepted that the world is round for more than half a millennium, with modern claims to the contrary only developing as an organizational creed when Samuel Shenton founded the International Flat Earth Research Society in 1956. Despite NASA astronauts returning with photographs of the Earth taken from the moon in 1969, the membership of the International Flat Earth Research Society peaked to 3500 members in the 1990s and now, with like-minded individuals finding each other on the internet, a number of different online \u201cFlat Earth Societies\u201d have gained modest followings. Armed as we are with common sense, a little bit of scientific knowledge, and the ability to fly around the Earth in an airplane and to view images taken from satellites and the International Space Station, how is this possible? How can people really believe that the Earth isn\u2019t round?\n\nTo understand Flat Earthers, and other people who hold unconventional beliefs, we need to first consider what it means to \u201cbelieve.\u201d A belief is a cognitive representation of the nature of reality, encompassing our inner experiences, the world around us, and the world beyond. In 1965, Oxford philosophy professor H.H. Price distinguished between \u201cbelieving in\u201d and \u201cbelieving that.\u201d1 As summarized by John Byrne, author of the website Skeptical Medicine, \u201cbelieving that\u201d something is true is a relatively straightforward matter of looking at the evidence. \u201cSeeing is believing\u201d is one kind of \u201cbelieving that.\u201d In contrast, we \u201cbelieve in\u201d something when there\u2019s no evidence and the belief isn\u2019t falsifiable. Religious faith is a kind of \u201cbelieving in.\u201d Both types of believing are normal cognitive capacities, but can run amok when conflated, resulting in beliefs that are poor models of reality.\n\nJust so, Flat Earthers often talk about planetary geometry in terms of \u201cbelief in\u201d rather than \u201cbelief that,\u201d as if the evidence for a spherical Earth is lacking. But that claim isn\u2019t really so much about believing. It's denialism.\n\nWhen Kyrie Irving was challenged about his flat earth beliefs, he replied:\n\n\u201cIs the world flat or round? \u2014 I think you need to do research on it. It\u2019s right in front of our faces. I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s right in front of our faces. They lie to us\u2026 Everything that was put in front of me, I had to be like, \u2018Oh, this is all a facade.\u2019 Like, this is all something that they ultimately want me to believe in\u2026 Question things, but even if an answer doesn\u2019t come back, you\u2019re perfectly fine with that, because you were never living in that particular truth. There\u2019s a falseness in stories and things that people want you to believe and ultimately what they throw in front of us.\u201d\n\nWith those words, Irving seems to be defending a denialist position that has the potential to give way to a slippery slope of rejecting all facts. According to that extreme version of denialism, nothing can be trusted, not even scientific evidence. Or maybe, as the physician and writer Atul Gawande wrote last year, it\u2019s not so much about mistrust of science, as it is about mistrusting scientists:\n\n\u201cToday, we have multiple factions putting themselves forward as what Gauchat describes as their own cultural domains, \u201cgenerating their own knowledge base that is often in conflict with the cultural authority of the scientific community.\u201d Some are religious groups (challenging evolution, for instance). Some are industry groups (as with climate skepticism). Others tilt more to the left (such as those that reject the medical establishment). As varied as these groups are, they are all alike in one way. They all harbor sacred beliefs that they do not consider open to question.\n\nTo defend those beliefs, few dismiss the authority of science. They dismiss the authority of the scientific community. People don\u2019t argue back by claiming divine authority anymore. They argue back by claiming to have the truer scientific authority. It can make matters incredibly confusing.\u201d\n\nSure enough, in a follow-up interview in which a reporter asked Irving if he\u2019d seen photographs of the Earth from space, he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of things that my educational system said was real, but turned out to be completely fake.\u201d\n\nThat kind of conspiratorial mistrust of established dogma was mirrored in a Paste magazine interview last year with John Davis, President of the American Flat Earth Society. When asked why he believed the world to be flat, Davis instead explained how he\u2019d arrived at that belief:\n\n\u201cOne day while walking in the woods as a young man I had a notable experience that lead me to question everything I\u2019ve taken for granted as true over the years; all those things we simply accept without properly examining their logical and rational basis and foundations. One could say like many today that up to this point I was standing on the shoulders of giants, but I had a deaf ear to both what they had to say about the matter as well as what assumptions they had to take to lead them to their position. This led me to a lengthy study into various ways we view the world, both orthodox and unorthodox, and their rational consequences and foundations. During this period of study and examination I came to some literature from the Flat Earth Society.\n\nSomething about it just resonated with me\u2014not only on a personal level, but also on a strictly logical level.\n\nOn another level, it seemed to me that some of the method used by this supposedly ridiculous group was far closer to the method of the aforementioned giants than what we see today from science as a whole. I remember thinking, \u2018These are people who truly value knowledge, and they do so at a real cost\u2014social stigma.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis account suggests that Flat Earthers often see themselves as approaching questions about reality like scientists do, from a philosophical perspective of skepticism. But while superficially related, scientific skepticism and denialism aren\u2019t the same thing at all.2 The former teaches that evidence is worthy of belief when an observation is repeated under properly controlled conditions, while the latter teaches that evidence, no matter how reproducible, can always be rejected out of hand as a matter of principle (for more on the distinction, check out Michael Shermer's Living in Denial: When a Sceptic Isn't a Sceptic and Steven Novella's Skepticism and Denial).\n\nWhen B.o.B. and Tila Tequila defended their flat earth beliefs, both fell back on the claim that the Earth can\u2019t be round because it appears flat on the horizon. While this position could be dismissed as mere ignorance grounded in the natural but error-prone tendency of the brain to treat perception as reality, the simultaneous rejection of the mountain of objective evidence to the contrary may further reflect a modern democratization of opinion, with personal belief placed on a equal footing with expertise. That kind of narcissism emboldened B.o.B. to feel qualified to debate physicist Neil Degrasse Tyson and for many others seems to be an increasingly adopted epistemology in today's \u201cpost-truth\u201d world.\n\nSo, does Kyrie Irving really, actually, and earnestly believe that if he kept going in a straight line, he would eventually run smack into the end of the Earth? I doubt it.\n\nInstead, he seems to have chosen a provocative example of scientific consensus to argue, perhaps with tongue in cheek, that we should seek truth and question authority along the way. That\u2019s reasonable advice, so long as we maintain a clear boundary between scientific skepticism and nihilistic denialism.\n\nIn terms of psychological and social health, we would all do well to be more flexible with our personal belief convictions, keeping an open mind to the possibility that we might be wrong. But at the same time, we would also do well to \u201cbelieve in\u201d the process of \u201cbelieving that.\u201d According to that advice, denialism holds us back, tethering us to false beliefs that are inconsistent with the facts and worthy of ridicule.", "metadata": {"article_number": "1731", "filename": "1731SSSArticle.txt"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 144, "uuid": "b3af3a91-39fc-4885-b385-e690b16a8de8", "generator": {"id": 28, "uuid": "2c0af7d1-921b-4b31-bcd6-a825c038e61b", "name": "FormTriager1.1C2", "task_config": {"contributor_id": null, "redundancy": 17, "batchname_regex": "SSSPETest2", "topic_ids": [39, 47, 35]}, "task_type": "HLTR"}, "article_id": 78, "info": {"article": {"article_number": 1731, "text": "title: Flat Earthers: Belief, Skepticism, and Denialism\nAuthor:  Susan Scutti\n\nDate: February 19, 2017\n\n\u201cYou are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in.

Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\n\nCleveland Cavaliers basketball star Kyrie Irving has apparently joined the dubious celebrity ranks of former The View host Sherri Shepherd, rapper B.o.B., and reality TV personality Tila Tequila by coming out in public to declare that the world is flat.\n\nIn a recent podcast leading up to the 2017 NBA All-Star Weekend, Irving said:\n\n\u201cFor what I\u2019ve known for many years and what I\u2019ve been taught is that the Earth is round, but if you really think about it from a landscape of the way we travel, the way we move and the fact that \u2014 can you really think of us rotating around the sun, and all planets align, rotating in specific dates, being perpendicular with what\u2019s going on with these planets and stuff like this.\u201d\n\nWith this quotation, Deadspin magazine ran the headline, \u201cKyrie Irving Really, Actually, Earnestly Believes The Earth Is Flat.\u201d\n\nBut does Irving, who spent his freshman year at Duke University before leaving for professional basketball, really, actually, and earnestly believe the earth is flat? Does anyone?\n\nWhile it\u2019s often said that human beings believed that the Earth was flat through the Middle Ages until Christopher Columbus set us straight in 1492, a more historically accurate account tells us that civilization had abandoned flat Earth theories at least a century before that. Educated people have therefore accepted that the world is round for more than half a millennium, with modern claims to the contrary only developing as an organizational creed when Samuel Shenton founded the International Flat Earth Research Society in 1956. Despite NASA astronauts returning with photographs of the Earth taken from the moon in 1969, the membership of the International Flat Earth Research Society peaked to 3500 members in the 1990s and now, with like-minded individuals finding each other on the internet, a number of different online \u201cFlat Earth Societies\u201d have gained modest followings. Armed as we are with common sense, a little bit of scientific knowledge, and the ability to fly around the Earth in an airplane and to view images taken from satellites and the International Space Station, how is this possible? How can people really believe that the Earth isn\u2019t round?\n\nTo understand Flat Earthers, and other people who hold unconventional beliefs, we need to first consider what it means to \u201cbelieve.\u201d A belief is a cognitive representation of the nature of reality, encompassing our inner experiences, the world around us, and the world beyond. In 1965, Oxford philosophy professor H.H. Price distinguished between \u201cbelieving in\u201d and \u201cbelieving that.\u201d1 As summarized by John Byrne, author of the website Skeptical Medicine, \u201cbelieving that\u201d something is true is a relatively straightforward matter of looking at the evidence. \u201cSeeing is believing\u201d is one kind of \u201cbelieving that.\u201d In contrast, we \u201cbelieve in\u201d something when there\u2019s no evidence and the belief isn\u2019t falsifiable. Religious faith is a kind of \u201cbelieving in.\u201d Both types of believing are normal cognitive capacities, but can run amok when conflated, resulting in beliefs that are poor models of reality.\n\nJust so, Flat Earthers often talk about planetary geometry in terms of \u201cbelief in\u201d rather than \u201cbelief that,\u201d as if the evidence for a spherical Earth is lacking. But that claim isn\u2019t really so much about believing. It's denialism.\n\nWhen Kyrie Irving was challenged about his flat earth beliefs, he replied:\n\n\u201cIs the world flat or round? \u2014 I think you need to do research on it. It\u2019s right in front of our faces. I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s right in front of our faces. They lie to us\u2026 Everything that was put in front of me, I had to be like, \u2018Oh, this is all a facade.\u2019 Like, this is all something that they ultimately want me to believe in\u2026 Question things, but even if an answer doesn\u2019t come back, you\u2019re perfectly fine with that, because you were never living in that particular truth. There\u2019s a falseness in stories and things that people want you to believe and ultimately what they throw in front of us.\u201d\n\nWith those words, Irving seems to be defending a denialist position that has the potential to give way to a slippery slope of rejecting all facts. According to that extreme version of denialism, nothing can be trusted, not even scientific evidence. Or maybe, as the physician and writer Atul Gawande wrote last year, it\u2019s not so much about mistrust of science, as it is about mistrusting scientists:\n\n\u201cToday, we have multiple factions putting themselves forward as what Gauchat describes as their own cultural domains, \u201cgenerating their own knowledge base that is often in conflict with the cultural authority of the scientific community.\u201d Some are religious groups (challenging evolution, for instance). Some are industry groups (as with climate skepticism). Others tilt more to the left (such as those that reject the medical establishment). As varied as these groups are, they are all alike in one way. They all harbor sacred beliefs that they do not consider open to question.\n\nTo defend those beliefs, few dismiss the authority of science. They dismiss the authority of the scientific community. People don\u2019t argue back by claiming divine authority anymore. They argue back by claiming to have the truer scientific authority. It can make matters incredibly confusing.\u201d\n\nSure enough, in a follow-up interview in which a reporter asked Irving if he\u2019d seen photographs of the Earth from space, he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of things that my educational system said was real, but turned out to be completely fake.\u201d\n\nThat kind of conspiratorial mistrust of established dogma was mirrored in a Paste magazine interview last year with John Davis, President of the American Flat Earth Society. When asked why he believed the world to be flat, Davis instead explained how he\u2019d arrived at that belief:\n\n\u201cOne day while walking in the woods as a young man I had a notable experience that lead me to question everything I\u2019ve taken for granted as true over the years; all those things we simply accept without properly examining their logical and rational basis and foundations. One could say like many today that up to this point I was standing on the shoulders of giants, but I had a deaf ear to both what they had to say about the matter as well as what assumptions they had to take to lead them to their position. This led me to a lengthy study into various ways we view the world, both orthodox and unorthodox, and their rational consequences and foundations. During this period of study and examination I came to some literature from the Flat Earth Society.\n\nSomething about it just resonated with me\u2014not only on a personal level, but also on a strictly logical level.\n\nOn another level, it seemed to me that some of the method used by this supposedly ridiculous group was far closer to the method of the aforementioned giants than what we see today from science as a whole. I remember thinking, \u2018These are people who truly value knowledge, and they do so at a real cost\u2014social stigma.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis account suggests that Flat Earthers often see themselves as approaching questions about reality like scientists do, from a philosophical perspective of skepticism. But while superficially related, scientific skepticism and denialism aren\u2019t the same thing at all.2 The former teaches that evidence is worthy of belief when an observation is repeated under properly controlled conditions, while the latter teaches that evidence, no matter how reproducible, can always be rejected out of hand as a matter of principle (for more on the distinction, check out Michael Shermer's Living in Denial: When a Sceptic Isn't a Sceptic and Steven Novella's Skepticism and Denial).\n\nWhen B.o.B. and Tila Tequila defended their flat earth beliefs, both fell back on the claim that the Earth can\u2019t be round because it appears flat on the horizon. While this position could be dismissed as mere ignorance grounded in the natural but error-prone tendency of the brain to treat perception as reality, the simultaneous rejection of the mountain of objective evidence to the contrary may further reflect a modern democratization of opinion, with personal belief placed on a equal footing with expertise. That kind of narcissism emboldened B.o.B. to feel qualified to debate physicist Neil Degrasse Tyson and for many others seems to be an increasingly adopted epistemology in today's \u201cpost-truth\u201d world.\n\nSo, does Kyrie Irving really, actually, and earnestly believe that if he kept going in a straight line, he would eventually run smack into the end of the Earth? I doubt it.\n\nInstead, he seems to have chosen a provocative example of scientific consensus to argue, perhaps with tongue in cheek, that we should seek truth and question authority along the way. That\u2019s reasonable advice, so long as we maintain a clear boundary between scientific skepticism and nihilistic denialism.\n\nIn terms of psychological and social health, we would all do well to be more flexible with our personal belief convictions, keeping an open mind to the possibility that we might be wrong.

Does anyone?\n\nWhile it\u2019s often said that human beings believed that the Earth was flat through the Middle Ages until Christopher Columbus set us straight in 1492, a more historically accurate account tells us that civilization had abandoned flat Earth theories at least a century before that. Educated people have therefore accepted that the world is round for more than half a millennium, with modern claims to the contrary only developing as an organizational creed when Samuel Shenton founded the International Flat Earth Research Society in 1956. Despite NASA astronauts returning with photographs of the Earth taken from the moon in 1969, the membership of the International Flat Earth Research Society peaked to 3500 members in the 1990s and now, with like-minded individuals finding each other on the internet, a number of different online \u201cFlat Earth Societies\u201d have gained modest followings. Armed as we are with common sense, a little bit of scientific knowledge, and the ability to fly around the Earth in an airplane and to view images taken from satellites and the International Space Station, how is this possible? How can people really believe that the Earth isn\u2019t round?\n\nTo understand Flat Earthers, and other people who hold unconventional beliefs, we need to first consider what it means to \u201cbelieve.\u201d A belief is a cognitive representation of the nature of reality, encompassing our inner experiences, the world around us, and the world beyond. In 1965, Oxford philosophy professor H.H. Price distinguished between \u201cbelieving in\u201d and \u201cbelieving that.\u201d1 As summarized by John Byrne, author of the website Skeptical Medicine, \u201cbelieving that\u201d something is true is a relatively straightforward matter of looking at the evidence. \u201cSeeing is believing\u201d is one kind of \u201cbelieving that.\u201d In contrast, we \u201cbelieve in\u201d something when there\u2019s no evidence and the belief isn\u2019t falsifiable. Religious faith is a kind of \u201cbelieving in.\u201d Both types of believing are normal cognitive capacities, but can run amok when conflated, resulting in beliefs that are poor models of reality.\n\nJust so, Flat Earthers often talk about planetary geometry in terms of \u201cbelief in\u201d rather than \u201cbelief that,\u201d as if the evidence for a spherical Earth is lacking. But that claim isn\u2019t really so much about believing. It's denialism.\n\nWhen Kyrie Irving was challenged about his flat earth beliefs, he replied:\n\n\u201cIs the world flat or round? \u2014 I think you need to do research on it. It\u2019s right in front of our faces. I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s right in front of our faces. They lie to us\u2026 Everything that was put in front of me, I had to be like, \u2018Oh, this is all a facade.\u2019 Like, this is all something that they ultimately want me to believe in\u2026 Question things, but even if an answer doesn\u2019t come back, you\u2019re perfectly fine with that, because you were never living in that particular truth. There\u2019s a falseness in stories and things that people want you to believe and ultimately what they throw in front of us.\u201d\n\nWith those words, Irving seems to be defending a denialist position that has the potential to give way to a slippery slope of rejecting all facts. According to that extreme version of denialism, nothing can be trusted, not even scientific evidence. Or maybe, as the physician and writer Atul Gawande wrote last year, it\u2019s not so much about mistrust of science, as it is about mistrusting scientists:\n\n\u201cToday, we have multiple factions putting themselves forward as what Gauchat describes as their own cultural domains, \u201cgenerating their own knowledge base that is often in conflict with the cultural authority of the scientific community.\u201d Some are religious groups (challenging evolution, for instance). Some are industry groups (as with climate skepticism). Others tilt more to the left (such as those that reject the medical establishment). As varied as these groups are, they are all alike in one way. They all harbor sacred beliefs that they do not consider open to question.\n\nTo defend those beliefs, few dismiss the authority of science. They dismiss the authority of the scientific community. People don\u2019t argue back by claiming divine authority anymore. They argue back by claiming to have the truer scientific authority. It can make matters incredibly confusing.\u201d\n\nSure enough, in a follow-up interview in which a reporter asked Irving if he\u2019d seen photographs of the Earth from space, he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of things that my educational system said was real, but turned out to be completely fake.\u201d\n\nThat kind of conspiratorial mistrust of established dogma was mirrored in a Paste magazine interview last year with John Davis, President of the American Flat Earth Society. When asked why he believed the world to be flat, Davis instead explained how he\u2019d arrived at that belief:\n\n\u201cOne day while walking in the woods as a young man I had a notable experience that lead me to question everything I\u2019ve taken for granted as true over the years; all those things we simply accept without properly examining their logical and rational basis and foundations. One could say like many today that up to this point I was standing on the shoulders of giants, but I had a deaf ear to both what they had to say about the matter as well as what assumptions they had to take to lead them to their position. This led me to a lengthy study into various ways we view the world, both orthodox and unorthodox, and their rational consequences and foundations. During this period of study and examination I came to some literature from the Flat Earth Society.\n\nSomething about it just resonated with me\u2014not only on a personal level, but also on a strictly logical level.\n\nOn another level, it seemed to me that some of the method used by this supposedly ridiculous group was far closer to the method of the aforementioned giants than what we see today from science as a whole. I remember thinking, \u2018These are people who truly value knowledge, and they do so at a real cost\u2014social stigma.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis account suggests that Flat Earthers often see themselves as approaching questions about reality like scientists do, from a philosophical perspective of skepticism. But while superficially related, scientific skepticism and denialism aren\u2019t the same thing at all.2 The former teaches that evidence is worthy of belief when an observation is repeated under properly controlled conditions, while the latter teaches that evidence, no matter how reproducible, can always be rejected out of hand as a matter of principle (for more on the distinction, check out Michael Shermer's Living in Denial: When a Sceptic Isn't a Sceptic and Steven Novella's Skepticism and Denial).\n\nWhen B.o.B. and Tila Tequila defended their flat earth beliefs, both fell back on the claim that the Earth can\u2019t be round because it appears flat on the horizon. While this position could be dismissed as mere ignorance grounded in the natural but error-prone tendency of the brain to treat perception as reality, the simultaneous rejection of the mountain of objective evidence to the contrary may further reflect a modern democratization of opinion, with personal belief placed on a equal footing with expertise. That kind of narcissism emboldened B.o.B. to feel qualified to debate physicist Neil Degrasse Tyson and for many others seems to be an increasingly adopted epistemology in today's \u201cpost-truth\u201d world.\n\nSo, does Kyrie Irving really, actually, and earnestly believe that if he kept going in a straight line, he would eventually run smack into the end of the Earth? I doubt it.\n\nInstead, he seems to have chosen a provocative example of scientific consensus to argue, perhaps with tongue in cheek, that we should seek truth and question authority along the way. That\u2019s reasonable advice, so long as we maintain a clear boundary between scientific skepticism and nihilistic denialism.\n\nIn terms of psychological and social health, we would all do well to be more flexible with our personal belief convictions, keeping an open mind to the possibility that we might be wrong.

But now physicists are questioning the conclusion, and they have a much larger dataset to back them up.\n\nFor a bit of background on the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, it was shared between cosmologists Saul Perlmutter from the University of California, Berkeley; Adam Riess from Johns Hopkins University; and Brian Schmidt from the Australian National University.\n\nDuring the 1990s, these three scientists were part of competing teams that were measuring distant Type 1a supernovae - the violent end of a type of star called a white dwarf.\n\nWhite dwarf stars are made from one of the densest forms of matter in the known Universe - surpassed only by neutron stars and black holes.\n\nWhile a typical white dwarf will only be slightly larger than Earth, it will have around the same amount of mass as our Sun. To put that into perspective, you could fit roughly 1,300,000 Earths inside the Sun. \n\nNow imagine that incredibly dense, dead star collapsing under the weight of its own gravity. We're talking about a luminosity level that's about 5 billion times brighter than the Sun.\n\nBecause each Type 1a supernova explodes with roughly the same brightness, the amount of light they give off can be used as an indication of their distance from Earth - and slight shifts in colour can also be used to figure out how fast they're moving.\n\nWhen Perlmutter, Riess, and Schmidt measured all the data for known Type 1a supernovae, recorded by the Hubble space telescope and a number of large ground-based telescopes, they found something incredibly strange. \n\nAs the Royal Swedish Academy explained on the morning of the Nobel Prize announcement in Stockholm:\n\n\"In a Universe which is dominated by matter, one would expect gravity eventually should make the expansion slow down.

But now physicists are questioning the conclusion, and they have a much larger dataset to back them up.\n\nFor a bit of background on the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, it was shared between cosmologists Saul Perlmutter from the University of California, Berkeley; Adam Riess from Johns Hopkins University; and Brian Schmidt from the Australian National University.\n\nDuring the 1990s, these three scientists were part of competing teams that were measuring distant Type 1a supernovae - the violent end of a type of star called a white dwarf.\n\nWhite dwarf stars are made from one of the densest forms of matter in the known Universe - surpassed only by neutron stars and black holes.\n\nWhile a typical white dwarf will only be slightly larger than Earth, it will have around the same amount of mass as our Sun.

But now physicists are questioning the conclusion, and they have a much larger dataset to back them up.\n\nFor a bit of background on the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, it was shared between cosmologists Saul Perlmutter from the University of California, Berkeley; Adam Riess from Johns Hopkins University; and Brian Schmidt from the Australian National University.\n\nDuring the 1990s, these three scientists were part of competing teams that were measuring distant Type 1a supernovae - the violent end of a type of star called a white dwarf.\n\nWhite dwarf stars are made from one of the densest forms of matter in the known Universe - surpassed only by neutron stars and black holes.\n\nWhile a typical white dwarf will only be slightly larger than Earth, it will have around the same amount of mass as our Sun. To put that into perspective, you could fit roughly 1,300,000 Earths inside the Sun. \n\nNow imagine that incredibly dense, dead star collapsing under the weight of its own gravity. We're talking about a luminosity level that's about 5 billion times brighter than the Sun.\n\nBecause each Type 1a supernova explodes with roughly the same brightness, the amount of light they give off can be used as an indication of their distance from Earth - and slight shifts in colour can also be used to figure out how fast they're moving.\n\nWhen Perlmutter, Riess, and Schmidt measured all the data for known Type 1a supernovae, recorded by the Hubble space telescope and a number of large ground-based telescopes, they found something incredibly strange. \n\nAs the Royal Swedish Academy explained on the morning of the Nobel Prize announcement in Stockholm:\n\n\"In a Universe which is dominated by matter, one would expect gravity eventually should make the expansion slow down. Imagine then the utter astonishment when two groups of scientists ... discovered that the expansion was not slowing down, it was actually accelerating.\n\nBy comparing the brightness of distant, far-away supernovae with the brightness of nearby supernovae, the scientists discovered that the far-away supernovae were about 25 percent too faint. They were too far away. The Universe was accelerating. And so this discovery is fundamental and a milestone for cosmology. And a challenge for generations of scientists to come.\" \n\nThe find was backed up by data collected separately on things like clustering galaxies and the cosmic microwave background - the faint afterglow of the Big Bang. \n\nAnd earlier this year, NASA and ESA scientists found that the Universe could be expanding around 8 percent faster than originally thought.\n\nBy all accounts, the discovery was a solid one (Nobel Prize solid) but it posed a very difficult question - if the collective gravity from all the matter expelled into the Universe by the Big Bang has been slowing everything down, how can it be accelerating?\n\nAs Brendan Cole reported for us in May:\n\n\"There's something pervading the Universe that physically spreads space apart faster than gravity can pull things together. The effect is small - it's only noticeable when you look at far-away galaxies - but it's there. It's become known as dark energy - 'dark', because no one knows what it is.\"\n\nSince scientists first proposed dark energy, no one's gotten any closer to figuring out what it could actually be.\n\nBut now an international team of physicists have questioned the acceration of the Universe's expansion, and they've got a much bigger database of Type 1a supernovae to back them up.\n\nBy applying a different analytical model to the 740 Type Ia supernovae that have been identified so far, the team says they've been able to account for the subtle differences between them like never before.\n\nThey say the statistical techniques used by the original team were too simplistic, and were based on a model devised in the 1930s, which can't reliability be applied to the growing supernova dataset.\n\nThey also mention that the cosmic microwave background isn't directly affected by dark energy, so only serves as an \"indirect\" type of evidence.\n\n\"We analysed the latest catalogue of 740 Type Ia supernovae - over 10 times bigger than the original samples on which the discovery claim was based - and found that the evidence for accelerated expansion is, at most, what physicists call '3 sigma',\" reports lead researcher, Subir Sarkar, from the University of Oxford.\n\n\"This is far short of the '5 sigma' standard required to claim a discovery of fundamental significance.\"\n\nInstead of finding evidence to support the accelerated expansion of the Universe, Sarkar and his team say it looks like the Universe is expanding at a constant rate. If that's truly the case, it means we don't need dark energy to explain it.\n\n\"A more sophisticated theoretical framework accounting for the observation that the Universe is not exactly homogeneous, and that its matter content may not behave as an ideal gas - two key assumptions of standard cosmology - may well be able to account for all observations without requiring dark energy,\" he says.\n\nNow, to be clear, this is just one study, and it's a big, extremely controversial claim that a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is fundamentally wrong.

Insomniacs should try camping, say scientists\n\nauthor: Henry Bodkin \n\nDate: 3 FEBRUARY 2017 \u2022 8:36AM\n\nver the years, insomniacs have been offered pills, plants, \u201cmindfulness\u201d, and even special lamps to help them get off to sleep.\n\nBut it now turns out that a far simpler solution has always been at hand, and one that is, literally, all around: the great outdoors.\n\nNew research suggests that rather than lying in bed miserably counting imaginary sheep, insomniacs should get out among some real ones and try a spot of camping.\n\nIf a person wants to go to bed at an earlier hour, then a weekend camping could be just the thing\nDr Kenneth Wright, University of Colorado Boulder\nAccording to a new study, just a couple of nights under canvas is enough to reset the body\u2019s internal clock, enabling people to fall asleep more quickly.\n\nModern living is increasingly depriving people of sufficient natural light, causing the timing of their circadian rhythm to slip.\n\nHowever, a new experiment by the University of Colorado revealed how a stint in the countryside is able to rapidly shift the timing forward by two and a half hours, allowing campers to go to bed at a civilised hour once they returned home.\n\nThe altered rhythms were detected by measuring levels of the hormone melatonin in the participants.\n\nGoing to bed late is thought to contribute not only to sleepiness and reduced productivity during the day, but also more serious conditions like mood disorders, diabetes and obesity.\n\n\u201cIf a person wants to go to bed at an earlier hour, then a weekend camping could be just the thing,\u201d said Dr Kenneth Wright, who led the research.\n\n\u201cOur findings demonstrate that living in our modern environment contributes to late circadian timing regardless of season and that a weekend camping trip can reset our clock rapidly.\u201d\n\nPrevious research by the same team established that people\u2019s modern exposure to electrical lighting causes roughly a two-hour delay in circadian timing and that a week of summer sun shifted those internal rhythms back.\n\n Insomniac woman\nInsomnia affects one in two Britons at some stage CREDIT: CLARA MOLDEN\nBut the scientists wanted to discover whether the same effect could be triggered by far shorter exposure.\n\nIn the new study, they sent a group of nine people out camping with no torches or mobile phones for a single weekend, and found that the light exposure was enough to bring their internal clocks forward.\n\nBeing outdoors and not having access to any technology also prevented the campers from delaying the time they went to sleep, which also helped reset their sleeping patterns.\n\nDr Wright said that, for most city-living people, modern living reduces light exposure by a factor of 13.\n\n\"Our findings highlight an opportunity for architectural design to bring in more natural sunlight into the modern built environment and to work with lighting companies to incorporate tunable lighting that would be able to change across the day and night to enhance performance, health, and well-being,\" he said.\n\nInsomnia is currently increasing in Britain, with one in two people enduring the disorder at some time.\n\nEarlier this week, Norwegian researchers reported a link between sleepless nights and asthma, saying chronic insomnia could triple the chances of developing the potentially fatal condition.\n\nNHS guidance recommends avoiding caffeine, nicotine and alcohol at night and not napping during the day for affected people.\n\nIf practical alterations such as these have no impact, GPs can recommend cognitive behavioural therapy, aimed at tackling unhelpful thoughts or actions that could be contributing to insomnia, or sleeping tablets in severe cases.\n\nThe new study was published in the journal Current Biology.\n\n", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1734:66c1049d-cbc1-4cf8-a398-832cf42cc112", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "337b76ddf39e3d9bce2f9af74ec716da60a029b3d83d217b2a01b8973f10ce9f", "id": 81, "metadata": {"article_number": "1734", "filename": "1734SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "0ab01231-2f3c-40a4-b791-ed0fa65208ab", "topic_number": 0, "glossary": {}, "name": "Quoted Sources", "instructions": "Use the 'Quoted Sources' label to highlight BOTH the names of anyone (person or organization) quoted or paraphrased in the article AND the quote or paraphrase itself.

HDL, or \u201cgood,\u201d cholesterol is associated with a lower risk because it helps remove excess LDL from the bloodstream.\n\nFor the current study, Hern\u00e1ez and colleagues examined data on 296 older adults at risk for cardiovascular disease who were randomly assigned to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with one liter per week (about 34 fluid ounces) of extra virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with 30 grams (1 oz) of nuts a day, or a low-fat diet.\n\nParticipants were 66 years old on average, and they were asked to follow their assigned diet for one year.\n\nOnly the low-fat diet was associated with reduced LDL and total cholesterol levels, researchers report in a paper scheduled for publication in the journal Circulation.\n\nNone of the diets increased HDL levels significantly.\n\nBut blood tests and lab work showed better HDL functioning in the group assigned to the Mediterranean diet with extra olive oil.\n\nWhile some previous research has linked a Mediterranean diet to weight loss and a reduced risk of heart disease and some cancers, scientists haven\u2019t conclusively proven that the diet itself is responsible, instead of other lifestyle choices made by people who eat this way.\n\nLimitations of the current study include the fact that all three diets were relatively healthy, making it difficult to detect meaningful differences in outcomes, the authors note.\n\nStill, the findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that HDL function may influence cardiovascular disease risk, Dr. Daniel Rader of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia writes in an accompanying editorial.\n\n\u201cWe know the Mediterranean diet reduces risk of heart disease but still don\u2019t know exactly why,\u201d Rader said by email. \u201cThere is probably more than one reason, and this study suggests that one mechanism might be that the Mediterranean diet improves the function of HDL.\u201d\n\nEven without clear evidence explaining why the Mediterranean diet may help the heart, eating this way can still make sense, Rader added.\n\n\u201cFor people who are interested in reducing their risk of heart disease, the Mediterranean diet is probably the best proven diet to reduce risk,\u201d Rader said. \u201cI think the majority of people who don\u2019t have other major dietary concerns should look toward the Mediterranean diet as a heart healthy diet.\u201d\n\n", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1728:9a5eddfd-cdd4-477a-af83-3a45d696ec20", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "b3ab388528c6115f1d85529f203b533fb84143f467acfc31d289bdc58c08d49d", "id": 75, "metadata": {"article_number": "1728", "filename": "1728SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "dd6978d0-e168-4599-b8c1-b0fc72585eb5", "topic_number": 2, "glossary": {}, "name": "Language", "instructions": "Use the \u2018Language\u2019 label to highlight for issues of tone and typos.
