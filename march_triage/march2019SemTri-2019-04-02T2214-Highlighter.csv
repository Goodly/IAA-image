The simulation totally upends the widely-held assumption that smaller ice sheets are significantly more vulnerable to breaks. That assumption, according to most experts at the NOAA, is responsible for every trusted model of sea level rise that gets cited in federal reports. Still, the highly-speculative nature of the simulation has some other scientists questioning the model assumptions.\n\n\u201cLook, we have no direct evidence of ice sheets that large having broken off in the last 30 years. That\u2019s when models like this became somewhat more reliable in terms of available data,\u201d said Dr. Marolf, perhaps the highest-profile NOAA member who dismissed the study. \u201cEven before that, the few examples of breaks we\u2019ve accounted for were so rare and poorly-understood that they constitute edge cases. And the simulation also ignores recent climate commitments from the OECD countries that should lower projected carbon emissions. So you see, this study is an extrapolation, on top of an extrapolation, on top of an extrapolation.\u201d\n\nDr. Marolf suggests that a follow-up simulation that incorporates most of her concerns would be worth paying attention to. However, \u201cideally [she would] want new ice core samples from at least a quarter of the sheets they\u2019ve pointed to\u201d so that the previous study could be somewhat falsified",2681

Without the coating, nerves gradually lose their ability to send important electrical messages that control things like movement and vision. In the study, people were randomly assigned to receive current treatments for the disease, which can help slow the progression of the immune-driven damage to the nerve cells, or a stem cell transplant.\r\n\r\nPeople in the stem cell transplant group received chemotherapy to wipe out most of their current immune cells that were wrongly attacking neurons. They then took special medications to coax their stem cells, which produce the entire population of immune cells, out of the bone marrow and into the blood to start churning out new immune cells. After approximately three years, about 6% of the stem cell group experienced relapses, while 60% of the people in the control group receiving standard treatment relapsed",4092

Since 1959, research has shown that 95 to 98 percent of attempts to lose weight fail and that two-thirds of dieters gain back more than they lost. The reasons are biological and irreversible. As early as 1969, research showed that losing just 3 percent of your body weight resulted in a 17 percent slowdown in your metabolism\u2014a body-wide starvation response that blasts you with hunger hormones and drops your internal temperature until you rise back to your highest weight.

Stephanie Sogg, a psychologist at the Mass General Weight Center, tells me she has clients who start eating compulsively after a sexual assault, others who starve themselves all day before bingeing on the commute home and others who eat 1,000 calories a day, work out five times a week and still insist that they\u2019re fat because they \u201chave no willpower.\u201d\r\n\r\nAcknowledging the infinite complexity of each person\u2019s relationship to food, exercise and body image is at the center of her treatment, not a footnote to it. \u201cEighty percent of my patients cry in the first appointment,\u201d Sogg says. \u201cFor something as emotional as weight, you have to listen for a long time before you give any advice. Telling someone, 'Lay off the cheeseburgers' is never going to work if you don't know what those cheeseburgers are doing for them",40086

Gudzune often spends months working with patients to set realistic goals\u2014playing with their grandkids longer, going off a cholesterol medication\u2014only to have other doctors threaten it all. One of her patients was making significant progress until she went to a cardiologist who told her to lose 100 pounds. \u201cAll of a sudden she goes back to feeling like a failure and we have to start over,\u201d Gudzune says. \u201cOr maybe she just never comes back at all",40086

For one thing, colds usually take a few days to build up, while the flu comes on more abruptly. \u201cSometimes [a flu] patient goes from well to very sick in a few minutes,\u201d says Dr. Jeffrey Steinbauer, a professor of family and community medicine at Baylor College of Medicine",6895

Also, a fever is much more common among flu patients, and the same is true of headaches, body aches and a dry cough. On the other hand, if you have a cough that produces a lot of fluid or mucous, you have a sore throat and you\u2019re sneezing or dealing with a runny nose or head congestion, all of those symptoms are more typical of colds, he says. (Worth noting: a stomachache, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms can crop up in kids, but they\u2019re not common among adults suffering from either a cold or flu. If you have these symptoms, you\u2019re probably dealing with a stomach virus or a food-borne illness.)\r\n\r\nThe timing of your symptoms can also be revealing. Colds are most common in early fall (usually right when students return to school) and in spring. But they\u2019re a year-round concern, says Dr. William Norcross, a principal investigator in public health at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cThey are somewhat more common in winter when people commonly gather indoors,\u201d he says. But you can catch a cold any time, whereas the flu is usually confined to its winter schedule",6895

Others target naturally occurring checkpoints that limit the anti-cancer activity of immune cells. Still others, like the CAR T-cell therapy recently approved to treat some types of leukemia and lymphomas, require a patient\u2019s immune cells to be removed from the body and genetically engineered to attack the tumor cells. Many of these approaches have been successful, but they each have downsides \u2014 from difficult-to-handle side effects to high-cost and lengthy preparation or treatment times.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll of these immunotherapy advances are changing medical practice,\u201d Levy said. \u201cOur approach uses a one-time application of very small amounts of two agents to stimulate the immune cells only within the tumor itself.

Immune cells like T cells recognize the abnormal proteins often present on cancer cells and infiltrate to attack the tumor. However, as the tumor grows, it often devises ways to suppress the activity of the T cells.\r\n\r\nLevy\u2019s method works to reactivate the cancer-specific T cells by injecting microgram amounts of two agents directly into the tumor site. (A microgram is one-millionth of a gram). One, a short stretch of DNA called a CpG oligonucleotide, works with other nearby immune cells to amplify the expression of an activating receptor called OX40 on the surface of the T cells. The other, an antibody that binds to OX40, activates the T cells to lead the charge against the cancer cells. Because the two agents are injected directly into the tumor, only T cells that have infiltrated it are activated. In effect, these T cells are \u201cprescreened\u201d by the body to recognize only cancer-specific proteins",7288

Injecting one tumor site with the two agents caused the regression not just of the treated tumor, but also of the second, untreated tumor. In this way, 87 of 90 mice were cured of the cancer. Although the cancer recurred in three of the mice, the tumors again regressed after a second treatment. The researchers saw similar results in mice bearing breast, colon and melanoma tumors.\r\n\r\nMice genetically engineered to spontaneously develop breast cancers in all 10 of their mammary pads also responded to the treatment. Treating the first tumor that arose often prevented the occurrence of future tumors and significantly increased the animals\u2019 life span, the researchers found.\r\n\r\nFinally, Sagiv-Barfi explored the specificity of the T cells by transplanting two types of tumors into the mice. She transplanted the same lymphoma cancer cells in two locations, and she transplanted a colon cancer cell line in a third location.

If successful, Levy believes the treatment could be useful for many tumor types. He envisions a future in which clinicians inject the two agents into solid tumors in humans prior to surgical removal of the cancer as a way to prevent recurrence due to unidentified metastases or lingering cancer cells, or even to head off the development of future tumors that arise due to genetic mutations like BRCA1 and 2",7288
