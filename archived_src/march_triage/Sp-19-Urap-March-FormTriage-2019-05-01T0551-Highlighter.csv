In families with two children, however, the first-born isn't necessarily the most intelligent since they only have a 60% chance of having a higher IQ.

Without the coating, nerves gradually lose their ability to send important electrical messages that control things like movement and vision. In the study, people were randomly assigned to receive current treatments for the disease, which can help slow the progression of the immune-driven damage to the nerve cells, or a stem cell transplant.\r\n\r\nPeople in the stem cell transplant group received chemotherapy to wipe out most of their current immune cells that were wrongly attacking neurons. They then took special medications to coax their stem cells, which produce the entire population of immune cells, out of the bone marrow and into the blood to start churning out new immune cells. After approximately three years, about 6% of the stem cell group experienced relapses, while 60% of the people in the control group receiving standard treatment relapsed.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not clear why the immune system in people with MS starts attacking its own nerve cells. But the idea of rebooting the immune system with healthy cells is one that is proving very effective in other fields as well. In cancer, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a similar strategy in which the immune cells causing certain leukemias are destroyed and replaced with genetically engineered cells that now recognize and can destroy cancer cells",4092

The most dramatic differences were seen between the surface of the jet dryer itself and the surface of the paper towel dispenser: In Udine, the dryer was covered in 100 times more bacteria, in Paris it was 33-fold higher, and in Leeds it was 22-fold.\r\n\r\nIn the UK restrooms, the notorious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacterium was found three times more frequently during jet dryer usage periods than paper towel periods. Bacterial species resistant to both penicillins and cephalosporins (known as ESBL-producing organisms) and species of pathogenic enterococci \u2013 a difficult-to-treat group \u2013 were found in significantly higher frequency and counts during these periods as well",4036

Also, a fever is much more common among flu patients, and the same is true of headaches, body aches and a dry cough. On the other hand, if you have a cough that produces a lot of fluid or mucous, you have a sore throat and you\u2019re sneezing or dealing with a runny nose or head congestion, all of those symptoms are more typical of colds, he says. (Worth noting: a stomachache, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms can crop up in kids, but they\u2019re not common among adults suffering from either a cold or flu. If you have these symptoms, you\u2019re probably dealing with a stomach virus or a food-borne illness.)\r\n\r\nThe timing of your symptoms can also be revealing. Colds are most common in early fall (usually right when students return to school) and in spring. But they\u2019re a year-round concern, says Dr. William Norcross, a principal investigator in public health at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cThey are somewhat more common in winter when people commonly gather indoors,\u201d he says. But you can catch a cold any time, whereas the flu is usually confined to its winter schedule.\r\n\r\nLook at the two under a microscope, and you\u2019ll see more differences. The flu is spread by two families of virus known as influenza A and influenza B, Norcross explains. Within these two families there\u2019s a great deal of variation, which is why the composition of the flu vaccine changes from year to year and is not always as effective as public health officials hope",6895

These include rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and others\u2014each of which can result in different symptoms and severities.\r\n\r\nWhile the common cold and flu can seem quite alike, there\u2019s one very important distinction: one is deadly, and the other is not. \u201cInfluenza kills about 35,000 Americans per year, whereas colds rarely cause lasting harm,\u201d Norcross says. For the most vulnerable people\u2014which includes those with weakened immune systems, the very old and babies born prematurely\u2014the flu is a common cause of pneumonia and death, the CDC warns.\r\n\r\nHow to prevent spreading the flu\r\nBecause of these risks, and because the symptoms of colds and flu can be hard to tell apart, experts say that it\u2019s vital for people to take steps to prevent the spread of these viruses. \u201cWhen you are sick with influenza or a cold, your mucus, saliva and everything coming from your nose, mouth and throat down to your lungs is teeming with millions of highly infectious virus particles,\u201d Norcross says. Sneezing, coughing or any other activities that transfer your mucous to your environment could make other people sick",6895

If flu symptoms hit you hard and you can see a doctor right away, these drugs may be helpful. Also, anyone at risk for serious complications\u2014the very old, the very young and those with weakened immune systems\u2014should tell their doctor if they\u2019re experiencing symptoms.\r\n\r\nBut for healthy adults and kids, colds and flu usually don\u2019t require a doctor\u2019s attention. \u201cI do not want people coming in for upper respiratory infections, because there\u2019s not much we can do for them,\u201d Barrett says. Even for people who believe they have the flu, most are better off just weathering the illness at home, he says. You\u2019ll be less likely to infect others that way, he says, and both colds and flu resolve on their own\u2014usually within a week. If that much time passes and your symptoms aren\u2019t improving, or they seem to be getting worse even after the first few days, it\u2019s time to see a doctor.
