That\u2019s when models like this became somewhat more reliable in terms of available data,\u201d said Dr. Marolf, perhaps the highest-profile NOAA member who dismissed the study. \u201cEven before that, the few examples of breaks we\u2019ve accounted for were so rare and poorly-understood that they constitute edge cases. And the simulation also ignores recent climate commitments from the OECD countries that should lower projected carbon emissions. So you see, this study is an extrapolation, on top of an extrapolation, on top of an extrapolation"
