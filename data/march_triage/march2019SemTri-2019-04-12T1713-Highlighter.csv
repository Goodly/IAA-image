The simulation totally upends the widely-held assumption that smaller ice sheets are significantly more vulnerable to breaks. That assumption, according to most experts at the NOAA, is responsible for every trusted model of sea level rise that gets cited in federal reports. Still, the highly-speculative nature of the simulation has some other scientists questioning the model assumptions.\n\n\u201cLook, we have no direct evidence of ice sheets that large having broken off in the last 30 years. That\u2019s when models like this became somewhat more reliable in terms of available data,\u201d said Dr. Marolf, perhaps the highest-profile NOAA member who dismissed the study. \u201cEven before that, the few examples of breaks we\u2019ve accounted for were so rare and poorly-understood that they constitute edge cases. And the simulation also ignores recent climate commitments from the OECD countries that should lower projected carbon emissions. So you see, this study is an extrapolation, on top of an extrapolation, on top of an extrapolation.\u201d\n\nDr. Marolf suggests that a follow-up simulation that incorporates most of her concerns would be worth paying attention to. However, \u201cideally [she would] want new ice core samples from at least a quarter of the sheets they\u2019ve pointed to\u201d so that the previous study could be somewhat falsified",2681

Without the coating, nerves gradually lose their ability to send important electrical messages that control things like movement and vision. In the study, people were randomly assigned to receive current treatments for the disease, which can help slow the progression of the immune-driven damage to the nerve cells, or a stem cell transplant.\r\n\r\nPeople in the stem cell transplant group received chemotherapy to wipe out most of their current immune cells that were wrongly attacking neurons. They then took special medications to coax their stem cells, which produce the entire population of immune cells, out of the bone marrow and into the blood to start churning out new immune cells.

In the study, people were randomly assigned to receive current treatments for the disease, which can help slow the progression of the immune-driven damage to the nerve cells, or a stem cell transplant.\r\n\r\nPeople in the stem cell transplant group received chemotherapy to wipe out most of their current immune cells that were wrongly attacking neurons. They then took special medications to coax their stem cells, which produce the entire population of immune cells, out of the bone marrow and into the blood to start churning out new immune cells.

The British Navy, wary of the cost of expanding the treatment, turned to malt wort, a mashed and cooked byproduct of barley which had the advantage of being cheaper but the disadvantage of doing nothing whatsoever to cure scurvy.

Since 1959, research has shown that 95 to 98 percent of attempts to lose weight fail and that two-thirds of dieters gain back more than they lost. The reasons are biological and irreversible. As early as 1969, research showed that losing just 3 percent of your body weight resulted in a 17 percent slowdown in your metabolism\u2014a body-wide starvation response that blasts you with hunger hormones and drops your internal temperature until you rise back to your highest weight.

But individuals are not averages: Studies have found that anywhere from one-third to three-quarters of people classified as obese are metabolically healthy. They show no signs of elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance or high cholesterol. Meanwhile, about a quarter of non-overweight people are what epidemiologists call \u201cthe lean unhealthy.\u201d A 2016 study that followed participants for an average of 19 years found that unfit skinny people were twice as likely to get diabetes as fit fat people.

As early as 1969, research showed that losing just 3 percent of your body weight resulted in a 17 percent slowdown in your metabolism\u2014a body-wide starvation response that blasts you with hunger hormones and drops your internal temperature until you rise back to your highest weight.

Fructose, for example, appears to damage insulin sensitivity and liver function more than other sweeteners with the same number of calories. People who eat nuts four times a week have 12 percent lower diabetes incidence and a 13 percent lower mortality rate regardless of their weight. All of our biological systems for regulating energy, hunger and satiety get thrown off by eating foods that are high in sugar, low in fiber and injected with additives.

The central failure of the medical system when it comes to obesity is that it treats every patient exactly the same: If you\u2019re fat, lose some weight. If you\u2019re skinny, keep up the good work. Stephanie Sogg, a psychologist at the Mass General Weight Center, tells me she has clients who start eating compulsively after a sexual assault, others who starve themselves all day before bingeing on the commute home and others who eat 1,000 calories a day, work out five times a week and still insist that they\u2019re fat because they \u201chave no willpower.\u201d\r\n\r\nAcknowledging the infinite complexity of each person\u2019s relationship to food, exercise and body image is at the center of her treatment, not a footnote to it. \u201cEighty percent of my patients cry in the first appointment,\u201d Sogg says. \u201cFor something as emotional as weight, you have to listen for a long time before you give any advice.

It was an ugly, smelly death, too, beginning with rattling teeth and ending with a body so rotted out from the inside that its victims could literally be startled to death by a loud noise. Just as horrifying as the disease itself, though, is that for most of those 300 years, medical experts knew how to prevent it and simply failed to.\r\n\r\nIn the 1600s, some sea captains distributed lemons, limes and oranges to sailors, driven by the belief that a daily dose of citrus fruit would stave off scurvy\u2019s progress. The British Navy, wary of the cost of expanding the treatment, turned to malt wort, a mashed and cooked byproduct of barley which had the advantage of being cheaper but the disadvantage of doing nothing whatsoever to cure scurvy. In 1747, a British doctor named James Lind conducted an experiment where he gave one group of sailors citrus slices and the others vinegar or seawater or cider. The results couldn\u2019t have been clearer. The crewmen who ate fruit improved so quickly that they were able to help care for the others as they languished. Lind published his findings, but died before anyone got around to implementing them nearly 50 years later",40086

The reason for this is that physicians are often required, in writing, to prove to hospital administrators and insurance providers that they have brought up their patient\u2019s weight and formulated a plan to bring it down\u2014regardless of whether that patient came in with arthritis or a broken arm or a bad sunburn. Failing to do that could result in poor performance reviews, low ratings from insurance companies or being denied reimbursement if they refer patients to specialized care.\r\n\r\nAnother issue, says Kimberly Gudzune, an obesity specialist at Johns Hopkins, is that many doctors, no matter their specialty, think weight falls under their authority. Gudzune often spends months working with patients to set realistic goals\u2014playing with their grandkids longer, going off a cholesterol medication\u2014only to have other doctors threaten it all. One of her patients was making significant progress until she went to a cardiologist who told her to lose 100 pounds. \u201cAll of a sudden she goes back to feeling like a failure and we have to start over,\u201d Gudzune says. \u201cOr maybe she just never comes back at all",40086

Samples of the air and swabs of restroom surfaces were taken every day for four weeks, then, after a two-week pause in collections, each restroom switched to offer the alternate drying method. This process was then repeated a third time.\r\n\r\nCultures from these samples revealed that the total amount of bacteria in the air and on surfaces was consistently much higher in all restrooms when jet dryers were being used. The most dramatic differences were seen between the surface of the jet dryer itself and the surface of the paper towel dispenser: In Udine, the dryer was covered in 100 times more bacteria, in Paris it was 33-fold higher, and in Leeds it was 22-fold",4036

While many people associate the flu with a fever, Barrett says this isn\u2019t always true. \u201cUnless someone comes in during the peak of flu season\u201d\u2014a two-month period that typically lands somewhere between November and March\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t tell very well whether it\u2019s cold or flu based solely on symptoms,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nBut while colds and flu can in many cases look a lot alike, there are some predictable differences. For one thing, colds usually take a few days to build up, while the flu comes on more abruptly. \u201cSometimes [a flu] patient goes from well to very sick in a few minutes,\u201d says Dr. Jeffrey Steinbauer, a professor of family and community medicine at Baylor College of Medicine",6895

Also, a fever is much more common among flu patients, and the same is true of headaches, body aches and a dry cough. On the other hand, if you have a cough that produces a lot of fluid or mucous, you have a sore throat and you\u2019re sneezing or dealing with a runny nose or head congestion, all of those symptoms are more typical of colds, he says. (Worth noting: a stomachache, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms can crop up in kids, but they\u2019re not common among adults suffering from either a cold or flu. If you have these symptoms, you\u2019re probably dealing with a stomach virus or a food-borne illness.)\r\n\r\nThe timing of your symptoms can also be revealing. Colds are most common in early fall (usually right when students return to school) and in spring. But they\u2019re a year-round concern, says Dr. William Norcross, a principal investigator in public health at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cThey are somewhat more common in winter when people commonly gather indoors,\u201d he says.

Sneezing, coughing or any other activities that transfer your mucous to your environment could make other people sick.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re feeling unwell, the best thing you can do is to isolate yourself until your symptoms go away. \u201cIf you go to work, the store or take the subway, you are likely to spread the illness,\u201d he says. If you have to leave the house, avoid touching your mouth or nose, wash your hands frequently and try to cough or sneeze into the crook of your arm.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also crucial that you get a flu shot\u2014preferably before the end of October. Depending on how well the vaccine\u2019s developers did at anticipating the season\u2019s influenza strains, the flu shot\u2019s effectiveness can vary from about 50% to 90%, Norcross says",6895

Immune cells like T cells recognize the abnormal proteins often present on cancer cells and infiltrate to attack the tumor. However, as the tumor grows, it often devises ways to suppress the activity of the T cells.\r\n\r\nLevy\u2019s method works to reactivate the cancer-specific T cells by injecting microgram amounts of two agents directly into the tumor site. (A microgram is one-millionth of a gram). One, a short stretch of DNA called a CpG oligonucleotide, works with other nearby immune cells to amplify the expression of an activating receptor called OX40 on the surface of the T cells. The other, an antibody that binds to OX40, activates the T cells to lead the charge against the cancer cells. Because the two agents are injected directly into the tumor, only T cells that have infiltrated it are activated.

Injecting one tumor site with the two agents caused the regression not just of the treated tumor, but also of the second, untreated tumor. In this way, 87 of 90 mice were cured of the cancer. Although the cancer recurred in three of the mice, the tumors again regressed after a second treatment. The researchers saw similar results in mice bearing breast, colon and melanoma tumors.\r\n\r\nMice genetically engineered to spontaneously develop breast cancers in all 10 of their mammary pads also responded to the treatment. Treating the first tumor that arose often prevented the occurrence of future tumors and significantly increased the animals\u2019 life span, the researchers found.\r\n\r\nFinally, Sagiv-Barfi explored the specificity of the T cells by transplanting two types of tumors into the mice. She transplanted the same lymphoma cancer cells in two locations, and she transplanted a colon cancer cell line in a third location. Treatment of one of the lymphoma sites caused the regression of both lymphoma tumors but did not affect the growth of the colon cancer cells",7288
