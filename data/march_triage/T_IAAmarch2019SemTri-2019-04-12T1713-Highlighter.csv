Stem Cell Treatment Could Be a Game-Changer for People With MS.txt,0fa1bbaf1bd387a2daabceba23abe8a57ef37365d368013555b5a60e8cdd92bc,c335c9a5-f2c1-4aca-9ff3-d1eefbdec23f,Evidence_2018_08_21,580,1663,Evidence,1,"The study involved 110 people with relapsing multiple sclerosis, a condition in which cells in the immune system start to inexplicably attack the critical covering that protects nerve cells in the spinal cord, brain and eye. Without the coating, nerves gradually lose their ability to send important electrical messages that control things like movement and vision. In the study, people were randomly assigned to receive current treatments for the disease, which can help slow the progression of the immune-driven damage to the nerve cells, or a stem cell transplant.\r\n\r\nPeople in the stem cell transplant group received chemotherapy to wipe out most of their current immune cells that were wrongly attacking neurons. They then took special medications to coax their stem cells, which produce the entire population of immune cells, out of the bone marrow and into the blood to start churning out new immune cells. After approximately three years, about 6% of the stem cell group experienced relapses, while 60% of the people in the control group receiving standard treatment relapsed"
