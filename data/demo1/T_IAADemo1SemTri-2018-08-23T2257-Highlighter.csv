For the study, researchers from Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of  Public Health looked at 375,000 Medicare patients who turned up in an emergency department for common reasons — such as falls, chest pain, ankle sprain, or back pain — and hadn’t used opioids in the six months before their hospital stay.

The study authors then split the group into patients who happened to be assigned to doctors who prescribed a lot of opioids, and patients who met doctors who didn’t. This was a clever study design, since the major difference between the groups was how the doctors prescribed opioids, which allowed the researchers to figure out whether the prescribing patterns influenced patients’ long-term use of painkillers. (In the study, “long-term use” was described as six or more months of daily opioids in the 12-month period following the ER visit"

The patients who saw the heavy opioid prescribers were three times more likely to receive a prescription for opioids compared with the patients who saw the more judicious opioid prescribers at the same hospital. The high prescribers doled out opioids to a quarter of their patients, while the more conservative prescribers only treated 7 percent with opioids on average, a variation the researchers thought was likely the result of inappropriate prescribing"

The scans showed that areas that saw increases in gray matter were the sections that process movement information, and more specifically the movement of a person’s legs. The team believes that may be related to the brain working harder to learn new ways of moving related to the lack of gravity. The scans also showed that the changes were more dramatic in the astronauts who spent months aboard the ISS as opposed to those who only had brief trips aboard the shuttle"

Just over 100 of the children were at high risk because they had an older sibling diagnosed with autism. The faster growth rate of the surface areas of their brains correctly predicted eight times out of 10 which of the high-risk children would go on to be diagnosed with the condition.

Enlargement of the brain seemed to correlate with the arrival of symptoms, says Heather Hazlett, a psychologist at the University of North Carolina’s Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities (CIDD), and the paper’s lead author. Still, with only 100 at-risk children, the study is too small to be considered definitive—nor should doctors rush to use MRIs to diagnose autism, Hazlett says"

One in every 68 children is diagnosed with autism; but among the younger siblings of a child on the spectrum, the rate is as high as one in five"
