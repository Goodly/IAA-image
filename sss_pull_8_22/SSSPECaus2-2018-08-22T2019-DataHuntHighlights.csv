If one of Owsley County’s 4,600 residents needs to visit the doctor, they have three choices: the health department or two clinics. But doctors are not always available or working, and opportunities for screening vary. For instance, mammograms are only offered once a month at the clinics, and colon cancer screenings are referred out of the county, and cervical cancer screenings are done weekly at the health department and daily at the clinic, Lucas said. The three regional hospitals are at least a 30-minute drive away on narrow, curvy mountain roads. The Markey Cancer Center in Lexington is a far drive for people in rural Appalachia.

According to Yao, 15 percent to 20 percent of women who have abnormal mammograms don’t go back for any follow-up tests, partly because of reasons such as these. “There are a lot of barriers,” he said.",9112
