While a typical white dwarf will only be slightly larger than Earth, it will have around the same amount of mass as our Sun. To put that into perspective, you could fit roughly 1,300,000 Earths inside the Sun. 

Now imagine that incredibly dense, dead star collapsing under the weight of its own gravity. We're talking about a luminosity level that's about 5 billion times brighter than the Sun.

Because each Type 1a supernova explodes with roughly the same brightness, the amount of light they give off can be used as an indication of their distance from Earth - and slight shifts in colour can also be used to figure out how fast they're moving.

When Perlmutter, Riess, and Schmidt measured all the data for known Type 1a supernovae, recorded by the Hubble space telescope and a number of large ground-based telescopes, they found something incredibly strange",6532
