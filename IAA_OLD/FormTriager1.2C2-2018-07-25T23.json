Dwayne Ellis credits the \"Alive at 25\" program for significantly reducing the number of crashes and deaths in his state.\n\"We've taught well over 6,000 kids since the (program's) inception in late 2008, and of those, we've been able to identify only six who have died in a crash either as a driver or passenger before their 25th birthday,\" said Ellis, who is the state's safety education coordinator.\nThough he was not able to provide numbers from 2007 to show the difference, he knows the program is extremely successful in part through feedback from both parents and young adults.\n\"What it does is, it talks about choice-making and consequences and how the choices that they make while driving not only affect them but affect everyone around them and everybody they know,\" Ellis said. \"We empower them to think about the consequences and make good choices and let them know they are in control of their life -- it's whether they want to take control.\"\nThe class, part of a national program, is given in schools as part of the drivers education curriculum or can be taken on a volunteer basis or as an insurance deduction. Some people who have received a citation for speeding may be required by the court to take the class.\nWyoming starts them young, beginning with safety lessons in kindergarten via the \"Little Convincer.\" This stationary platform used in presentations demonstrates how teddy bears not buckled into their seats will fall out during a crash. Then, the kids themselves can buckle themselves into the seat.\nThe adult version of the \"convincer\" uses a rollover machine and unrestrained dummies who are ejected, flying through the air, when they're not properly buckled into place.\n\nBack on the national level, Kolosh believes the US is still doing better overall than in the past.\n\"The number of deaths on our roadways really peaked in the 1970s,\" he said. Back then, \"a lot of the safety advances that we've all become quite accustomed to\" had not yet taken place,\" he noted.\n\nAt that time, the US did not have strong DUI laws or a lot of safety advances (such as airbags) in vehicles. The nation also did not have graduated programs to ease teenagers into becoming full-fledged licensed drivers.\n\n\"Our roads are much safer than they were in the '70s,\" Kolosh said.\n", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1730:71c35502-7498-49b0-8e76-ad974ca60198", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "2d6de61b16c3ade370a26e2c410c884184c1272615b2be897518a54592c00cfd", "id": 77, "metadata": {"article_number": "1730", "filename": "1730SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "0ab01231-2f3c-40a4-b791-ed0fa65208ab", "topic_number": 0, "glossary": {}, "name": "Quoted Sources", "instructions": "Use the 'Quoted Sources' label to highlight BOTH the names of anyone (person or organization) quoted or paraphrased in the article AND the quote or paraphrase itself.

This is the sharpest two-year rise since 1964, says the council, a nonprofit focused on eliminating preventable deaths.\n\nThe worst month in 2016 was October, which contributed 3,790 to the total 40,200 highway deaths, according to the report. January saw the lowest number, with 2,740 deaths.\n\nAs might be expected due to the overall population of certain individual states, Texas, California and Florida each had more than 3,000 deaths in 2016.\nAlaska, Vermont, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia had the least, with fewer than 100 deaths each.\n\nOverall, the researchers estimated 12.4 deaths per 100,000 people in 2016, a 5% increase over the 2015 rate. They also estimate about 4.6 million motor-vehicle injuries required a medical consultation in 2016, an increase of 7% from 2015.\nFigures from 2014 and 2015 were gathered from the National Center for Health Statistics, but estimates for 2016 are still considered a preliminary tally, compiled by the safety council from each state's traffic authorities.\n\nMore drivers on the road\n\n\"During the recession, the number of deaths on our roadways went down a lot. We were driving less,\" said Ken Kolosh, manager of statistics at the National Safety Council. Traffic deaths dropped during the years 2008 through 2010, with a very slow increase then taking place until 2015.\n\nThese days, gas prices are lower and job growth is better, so people are traveling more often. For 2016, the council estimated a 3% increase in motor-vehicle mileage over the previous year, however, this increase in traffic, unfortunately, also leads to a swelling number of highway fatalities.\n\nHowever, a 3% increase in miles driven versus a 6% increase in deaths suggests something else is at play.\n\nKolosh saw evidence that \"teenagers and young drivers were impacted and lost access to vehicles during the recession.\" With the economy improving, teens are back on the highways, he said.\n\n\"We see actually a decrease in drivers talking on their phones -- either handheld or hands-free -- but increasingly, we're seeing drivers texting or doing other activities on their phones,\" Kolosh said. Not surprisingly, he points to \"our younger drivers, the 15- to 24-year-olds\" as most responsible for this shift.\n\n\"At any given daylight moment, nearly 5% of them are likely texting or doing something else on their phones while behind the wheel,\" he said. \"We're also seeing a very, very large increase in the number of vulnerable road users who are dying on our roads.\"\n\nVulnerable road users include pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists.\nThough it's known that distracted driving is on the rise, \"the role of the distracted pedestrian\" may be an understudied problem, according to Kolosh, who cites a 9% increase in the number of pedestrian deaths on the road between 2015 and 2016.\n\"We are pretty sure there's more distracted pedestrians in our towns, on our sidewalks, than ever before, and that's probably increasing,\" he said.

David Wagener of the Wyoming Highway Patrol finds it difficult to pinpoint the reason why his state is leading the nation in decreased highway fatalities.\n\"There was some slowdown in coal and other natural resource industries in Wyoming in 2016, so there were less people on the highways because of that, and there was less traffic moving, so that's one reason,\" he said.\n\"But really,\" he said, \"it comes down to the individual making good decisions before they get behind the wheel and good decisions when they are driving.\"\nThose good decisions include \"making sure they get enough sleep, making sure they're not driving impaired, making sure they're wearing seat belts, making sure children in the vehicle are buckled in or wearing child restraints.\"\nHis unofficial numbers match up with the estimates from the Safety Council.\n\"According to the spreadsheet I have, 55 of those 112 fatalities had a seat belt available in the vehicle they were in, yet they chose not to wear it at the time of the crash,\" Wagener said.\n\"We have 34 listed as alcohol-related,\" he added. Wyoming also counted 24 deaths among motorcyclists -- 39 rollover-related, nine weather-related -- and three deaths among ATV drivers.\n\nHighway Patrol Sgt. Dwayne Ellis credits the \"Alive at 25\" program for significantly reducing the number of crashes and deaths in his state.\n\"We've taught well over 6,000 kids since the (program's) inception in late 2008, and of those, we've been able to identify only six who have died in a crash either as a driver or passenger before their 25th birthday,\" said Ellis, who is the state's safety education coordinator.\nThough he was not able to provide numbers from 2007 to show the difference, he knows the program is extremely successful in part through feedback from both parents and young adults.\n\"What it does is, it talks about choice-making and consequences and how the choices that they make while driving not only affect them but affect everyone around them and everybody they know,\" Ellis said. \"We empower them to think about the consequences and make good choices and let them know they are in control of their life -- it's whether they want to take control.\"\nThe class, part of a national program, is given in schools as part of the drivers education curriculum or can be taken on a volunteer basis or as an insurance deduction. Some people who have received a citation for speeding may be required by the court to take the class.\nWyoming starts them young, beginning with safety lessons in kindergarten via the \"Little Convincer.\" This stationary platform used in presentations demonstrates how teddy bears not buckled into their seats will fall out during a crash. Then, the kids themselves can buckle themselves into the seat.\nThe adult version of the \"convincer\" uses a rollover machine and unrestrained dummies who are ejected, flying through the air, when they're not properly buckled into place.\n\nBack on the national level, Kolosh believes the US is still doing better overall than in the past.\n\"The number of deaths on our roadways really peaked in the 1970s,\" he said. Back then, \"a lot of the safety advances that we've all become quite accustomed to\" had not yet taken place,\" he noted.\n\nAt that time, the US did not have strong DUI laws or a lot of safety advances (such as airbags) in vehicles. The nation also did not have graduated programs to ease teenagers into becoming full-fledged licensed drivers.\n\n\"Our roads are much safer than they were in the '70s,\" Kolosh said.\n", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1730:71c35502-7498-49b0-8e76-ad974ca60198", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "2d6de61b16c3ade370a26e2c410c884184c1272615b2be897518a54592c00cfd", "id": 77, "metadata": {"article_number": "1730", "filename": "1730SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "dd6978d0-e168-4599-b8c1-b0fc72585eb5", "topic_number": 2, "glossary": {}, "name": "Language", "instructions": "Use the \u2018Language\u2019 label to highlight for issues of tone and typos.

Normally, the animals woke and slept on a 12-hour cycle. When the lights were on in the lab, the mice were active. When it went dark on a timer, down they went. But Zielinski, who teaches psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, had recently tweaked their schedule to keep the mice up past their bedtime.\n\nZielinski and his colleagues would rustle the bedding in the mice's cages to keep them from dozing off when they started to display the telltale signs of sleepiness\u2014drooping lids, sluggish walk, EEG readings showing their brain activity was waning. But Zielinski noticed that when the mice were left alone to slumber at will after the disruption, they didn't, or perhaps couldn't, fall asleep.\n\nThat the sleep-deprived rodents slept less than they normally would didn't really surprise Zielinski. The mice had a genetic mutation that he suspected was linked to sleep problems. More striking were the electrical brain readings showing that even when they did sleep, they weren't getting the deep, restorative kind of rest that doctors say matters most\u2014not just to rodents but also to humans.\n\nIn the right conditions, researchers believe, the brain produces a signal that essentially tells the body's major systems\u2014the heart, the lungs, the digestive system, the nervous system, even the muscles\u2014that it's time to call it quits for the day. Zielinski's research has found that, just as with the mice with the mutation, it's likely that in some people with chronic sleep problems, that critical signal isn't firing.\n\nUnderstanding what's behind some forms of insomnia, an aim of Zielinski's research, is a major step in learning how to fix it. That's a big deal in sleep research, because evidence linking quality rest to good health and longevity has never been more convincing.\n\nScientists are learning that shortchanging sleep can compromise nearly every major body system, from the brain to the heart to the immune system, making our inability\u2014or unwillingness\u2014to sleep enough one of the unhealthiest things we can do.\nStudies of people whose sleep sessions are irregular or short show they are at higher risk of developing diseases that can lead to early death, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. Poor sleep may have detrimental effects on the brain as well, increasing the risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, as well as mood disorders like depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. And like smoking, a terrible diet and not exercising enough, poor sleep is now linked to an overall increased risk of premature death.\n\n\"I used to suggest that sleep is the third pillar of good health, along with diet and exercise,\" says Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. \"But I don't agree with that anymore. Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do to reset your brain and body for health.\"\nDespite the mounting evidence of its benefits, Americans are sleeping about two hours less each night than they did a century ago. Blame the technology-fueled 24/7 workplace, social media or the relentless news cycle, but about one-third of U.S. adults sleep less than the recommended seven hours daily, and 40% report feeling drowsy during the day, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The problem begins early: only 15% to 30% of U.S. teens get the 8\u00bd hours a night recommended for adolescents.\n\nWhile life expectancy has been inching upward over the past century thanks to advances in medicine and technology, those gains could start to sag under the weight of our collective sleeplessness. Many people still dismiss sleep as something they can occasionally (or even regularly) skimp on, but the biological facts are clear: it is neither safe nor wise to take sleep lightly.\n\n\"To me, sleep is like the canary in the coal mine,\" says David Schnyer, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Texas, Austin. \"Changes in sleep can create systemwide changes in the organism, and all of the stages of sleep affect the entire body and brain.\"\n\nThat's why sleep deprivation is so strongly linked to disease and premature death. One recent study even showed that sleep deprivation in mice can cause death faster than starvation can. And yet doctors\u2014those who talk to their patients about sleep in the first place, anyway\u2014report that many people still aren't convinced that their nightly rest is a critical piece of the long-life puzzle. Health obsessives who would never touch a cigarette and pride themselves on avoiding junk food may also boast about how much they get done, and how little they sleep at night.\n\n\"Because we're asleep, we don't see the benefits of it,\" says Robert Stickgold, a well-known sleep researcher and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. \"That's the disaster and tragedy of our current world.\"\n\nIt's been that way for a long time. Benjamin Franklin famously quipped that \"there will be sleeping enough in the grave,\" and today, sleep is still misperceived as one of the most duty-driven and unproductive parts of the day\u2014the habit that gets in the way of life as opposed to the one most likely to extend it.\n\nPerhaps that's because until very recently, scientists couldn't even agree on the evolutionary reason why animals need to sleep in the first place. But now they know that what happens during sleep, particularly in the brain, is critical to human well-being\u2014not to mention a long life. That's why they also know that the cost of ignoring the latest science on sleep can be dear.\n\nSpending a good third of the day oblivious to the world around you and, by extension, incapable of protecting yourself doesn't seem like a smart way for a species to stay alive. And yet every animal does it, leading scientists to accept that sleep must be nonnegotiable for some reason\u2014and that we must need a certain amount of it to survive.\n\nFollowing a rigorous, milestone study in 2002 of more than 1 million healthy men and women by the American Cancer Society, experts suggested that the magic amount of sleep for longevity was seven hours a night. People who slept that amount were most likely to still be alive at the end of the study's six years, compared with people who got either six hours or less, or eight hours or more, of sleep each night. To this day, that's typically the amount that doctors and public-health groups recommend for the average adult, though older people can probably get away with a little less sleep than that, and younger people need more.\n\nAnother even longer study, which followed more than 21,000 twins in Finland, found that people who were regularly sleeping less than seven hours daily were 21% to 26% more likely to die of any cause during the study's 22-year period than those who slept more than eight hours.\n\nSo clearly sleep has some real biological benefit. Could it just be that the brain and body need downtime to recuperate after the activity of the day? That was the most popular explanation for decades, until an inquisitive neuroscientist at the University of Rochester decided to look for the answer inside the brain itself. When she did, Dr. Maiken Nedergaard uncovered what many scientists now agree is sleep's primary evolutionary function: to clean out the brain, quite literally, of accumulating debris.\n\nIn 2014, Nedergaard first revealed that while the body appears to rest during sleep, a whole lot is happening inside the brain. Neurons pulse with electrical signals that wash over the brain in a rhythmic flow. The brain runs checks on itself to ensure that the balance of hormones, enzymes and proteins isn't too far off-kilter. All the while, brain cells contract, opening up the spaces between them so that fluid can wash out the toxic detritus that can cause all kinds of problems if it builds up.\n\"It's like a dishwasher that keeps flushing through to wash the dirt away,\" Nedergaard says.\n\nWithout that nightly wash cycle, dangerous toxins can damage healthy cells and interfere with their ability to communicate with one another. In the short term, that can impede memory formation and the ability to coherently compose our thoughts and regulate our emotions. Over time, the consequences can be more dire. Lack of sleep can lead to faster aging of brain cells, contributing to diseases like Alzheimer's, which is now the cause of death for 1 in 3 seniors.\n\nNedergaard's research, which was done in mice, prompted a crucial rethinking of not only the benefits of sleep but also its biological function. It turns out the brain and body are extremely active when we sleep\u2014we're just not aware of most of what occurs while we do it.\n\n\"Sleep is not just a passive state but a fairly active state on the molecular level,\" says Dr. Allan Pack, director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology at the University of Pennsylvania. \"During the day, the brain is using energy resources to fire neurons. At night, a switch turns on so the sleeping brain can take advantage of the metabolic downtime to do some cleaning up.\"\n\nThe idea that sleep is a time of important biological activity, rather than a period when the body checks out, is transforming how doctors think about another important factor in longevity: mental health.\n\nScientists have long known that sleep is important for memory. But it turns out that during sleep, especially the cycles of deep dream sleep, the brain doesn't just revisit the events of a day in a more organized way. It also works on processing the emotions attached to these recollections. When a memory is filed away during sleep, it's also stripped of some of the powerful feelings\u2014like fear, grief, anger or joy\u2014that might have clouded the experiences in the heat of the moment.\n\nIt wouldn't be healthy, or efficient, to remember every event or experience in its full factual and emotional context. But separating the emotional aspects of a memory\u2014the anger over an argument with your spouse, the frustration at the guy who cut you off in traffic, the dejection you felt after getting a curt email reply from your boss\u2014from its objective parts allows you to recall the experience without reliving it. \"We sleep to remember and we sleep to forget,\" says Walker, the UC Berkeley sleep scientist, of this coping mechanism. \"I call it overnight therapy.\"\n\nThis type of processing takes time. It likely happens only during deep, quality sleep, and only over consistent nights of such sleep. That may explain why people who cut their sleep short or experience interrupted sleep may not fully disentangle the emotional baggage from their memories.\n\nIn those cases the memory, in its emotionally taxing entirety, continues to resurface every time the brain tries to sleep, in a vain effort to be properly processed. The brain tries to store the memory in a neutral way, but without deep sleep, there just isn't enough time for that triage.\n\nWalker believes these aborted efforts may drive conditions like PTSD, which is well understood to be common among combat veterans but which may be more common among the general population than therapists and researchers previously thought.\n\n\"The more nights you sleep, the more soothing the influence of sleep on that memory,\" he says. \"Sleep continues to work on those emotional memories and flatten them out after about a week. Now there's great evidence that PTSD is a disorder in which that process fails.\"\n\nWalker saw this effect firsthand when he showed a group of people a frightening video. He kept some of the people awake after the viewing and allowed the rest to sleep normally. Those who were not allowed to sleep properly were more likely to remember the negative aspects of the video than those who got enough sleep.\n\nThere's also strong support for the idea that insufficient sleep may be a trigger for, and not just a symptom of, a number of mental illnesses, including depression, bipolar disorder and even schizophrenia. Depriving people with bipolar disorder of sleep, for example, can launch a manic episode, while some people with depression report worsening symptoms when they aren't sleeping well.\n\nFully understanding the role sleep plays in mental illness is a rich area of future research. Already many doctors think consistent, high-quality sleep can have a direct bearing on the health of those with mental illness. \"Anyone who suffers from moderate or significant mental-health concerns needs to be aware that sleep may be one of the most important things they can do,\" says Walker.\n\nStress, scientists also know, is one of the more potent accelerators of aging, and a body that's not sleeping enough looks similar to one that's stressed out\u2014it's highly reactive to perceived threats, even when those threats don't pose any real risk. Biologically speaking, there's virtually no difference in the way a body reacts to a startling noise in the middle of the night, a rabid raccoon or a stressful work deadline: in all cases, fight-or-flight mode is triggered, blood pressure spikes, breathing gets shallow, and the heart starts to race. That's what happens to a body on no sleep too.\n\nThose stress reactions can be useful, of course: they help you respond more readily to an actual physical threat. But that's not usually what's going on. And staying in an alert mode can trigger a number of unhealthy conditions, the most damaging of which is inflammation.\n\nInflammation is the body's natural defense system against injury or invading microbes like bacteria and viruses. It's why your toe turns red and throbs when you stub it or when it's infected: white blood cells rush to the area in order to protect it for the short time it's needed to help you get better. But inflammation can also become chronic, and that's when the real trouble starts.\n\nChronic inflammation, doctors now know, is a leading driver of many diseases, including some cancers, cognitive decline, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes\u2014even chronic pain. And one of the main drivers of chronic inflammation is, of course, not sleeping enough.\n\nGetting a decent night's sleep, then, is good advice for all of us. Americans spent an estimated $41 billion on sleeping pills and other sleep aids in 2015; no matter how much we may boast about our stamina, we know intuitively that we need sleep, even if we don't always know why.\n\nBut scientists do. That's why experts are insisting, with increasing frequency and noise, that sleep be a priority\u2014as important or more than what you eat and how much you exercise. We wouldn't dream of skipping meals on a regular basis, so why skimp on sleep?\n\nThere's still much about sleep that mystifies scientists\u2014particularly about what goes wrong for so many of us, night after night. But as they chip away at the underlying causes of sleeplessness, they get ever closer to a cure. Harvard's Zielinski, for one, is hopeful that they will eventually find a way to help more people sleep better every night.When he gave his sleepless mice a drug to fix the mutation that was interfering with their sleep in the first place, they began to slumber anew.", "metadata": {"article_number": "1736", "filename": "1736SSSArticle.txt"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 149, "uuid": "98bbfba9-2beb-4784-b6bc-bc10185f6674", "generator": {"id": 28, "uuid": "2c0af7d1-921b-4b31-bcd6-a825c038e61b", "name": "FormTriager1.1C2", "task_config": {"contributor_id": null, "redundancy": 17, "batchname_regex": "SSSPETest2", "topic_ids": [39, 47, 35]}, "task_type": "HLTR"}, "article_id": 83, "info": {"article": {"article_number": 1736, "text": "title: The Sleep Cure: The Fountain of Youth May Be Closer Than You Ever Thought\n\nauthor: Alice Park\n\nDate: FEB. 15, 2017\n\nMark Zielinski knew he was onto something when his mice stopped sleeping. Normally, the animals woke and slept on a 12-hour cycle. When the lights were on in the lab, the mice were active. When it went dark on a timer, down they went. But Zielinski, who teaches psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, had recently tweaked their schedule to keep the mice up past their bedtime.\n\nZielinski and his colleagues would rustle the bedding in the mice's cages to keep them from dozing off when they started to display the telltale signs of sleepiness\u2014drooping lids, sluggish walk, EEG readings showing their brain activity was waning. But Zielinski noticed that when the mice were left alone to slumber at will after the disruption, they didn't, or perhaps couldn't, fall asleep.\n\nThat the sleep-deprived rodents slept less than they normally would didn't really surprise Zielinski. The mice had a genetic mutation that he suspected was linked to sleep problems. More striking were the electrical brain readings showing that even when they did sleep, they weren't getting the deep, restorative kind of rest that doctors say matters most\u2014not just to rodents but also to humans.\n\nIn the right conditions, researchers believe, the brain produces a signal that essentially tells the body's major systems\u2014the heart, the lungs, the digestive system, the nervous system, even the muscles\u2014that it's time to call it quits for the day. Zielinski's research has found that, just as with the mice with the mutation, it's likely that in some people with chronic sleep problems, that critical signal isn't firing.\n\nUnderstanding what's behind some forms of insomnia, an aim of Zielinski's research, is a major step in learning how to fix it. That's a big deal in sleep research, because evidence linking quality rest to good health and longevity has never been more convincing.\n\nScientists are learning that shortchanging sleep can compromise nearly every major body system, from the brain to the heart to the immune system, making our inability\u2014or unwillingness\u2014to sleep enough one of the unhealthiest things we can do.\nStudies of people whose sleep sessions are irregular or short show they are at higher risk of developing diseases that can lead to early death, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. Poor sleep may have detrimental effects on the brain as well, increasing the risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, as well as mood disorders like depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. And like smoking, a terrible diet and not exercising enough, poor sleep is now linked to an overall increased risk of premature death.\n\n\"I used to suggest that sleep is the third pillar of good health, along with diet and exercise,\" says Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. \"But I don't agree with that anymore. Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do to reset your brain and body for health.\"\nDespite the mounting evidence of its benefits, Americans are sleeping about two hours less each night than they did a century ago. Blame the technology-fueled 24/7 workplace, social media or the relentless news cycle, but about one-third of U.S. adults sleep less than the recommended seven hours daily, and 40% report feeling drowsy during the day, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The problem begins early: only 15% to 30% of U.S. teens get the 8\u00bd hours a night recommended for adolescents.\n\nWhile life expectancy has been inching upward over the past century thanks to advances in medicine and technology, those gains could start to sag under the weight of our collective sleeplessness. Many people still dismiss sleep as something they can occasionally (or even regularly) skimp on, but the biological facts are clear: it is neither safe nor wise to take sleep lightly.\n\n\"To me, sleep is like the canary in the coal mine,\" says David Schnyer, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Texas, Austin. \"Changes in sleep can create systemwide changes in the organism, and all of the stages of sleep affect the entire body and brain.\"\n\nThat's why sleep deprivation is so strongly linked to disease and premature death. One recent study even showed that sleep deprivation in mice can cause death faster than starvation can. And yet doctors\u2014those who talk to their patients about sleep in the first place, anyway\u2014report that many people still aren't convinced that their nightly rest is a critical piece of the long-life puzzle. Health obsessives who would never touch a cigarette and pride themselves on avoiding junk food may also boast about how much they get done, and how little they sleep at night.\n\n\"Because we're asleep, we don't see the benefits of it,\" says Robert Stickgold, a well-known sleep researcher and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. \"That's the disaster and tragedy of our current world.\"\n\nIt's been that way for a long time. Benjamin Franklin famously quipped that \"there will be sleeping enough in the grave,\" and today, sleep is still misperceived as one of the most duty-driven and unproductive parts of the day\u2014the habit that gets in the way of life as opposed to the one most likely to extend it.\n\nPerhaps that's because until very recently, scientists couldn't even agree on the evolutionary reason why animals need to sleep in the first place. But now they know that what happens during sleep, particularly in the brain, is critical to human well-being\u2014not to mention a long life. That's why they also know that the cost of ignoring the latest science on sleep can be dear.\n\nSpending a good third of the day oblivious to the world around you and, by extension, incapable of protecting yourself doesn't seem like a smart way for a species to stay alive. And yet every animal does it, leading scientists to accept that sleep must be nonnegotiable for some reason\u2014and that we must need a certain amount of it to survive.\n\nFollowing a rigorous, milestone study in 2002 of more than 1 million healthy men and women by the American Cancer Society, experts suggested that the magic amount of sleep for longevity was seven hours a night. People who slept that amount were most likely to still be alive at the end of the study's six years, compared with people who got either six hours or less, or eight hours or more, of sleep each night. To this day, that's typically the amount that doctors and public-health groups recommend for the average adult, though older people can probably get away with a little less sleep than that, and younger people need more.\n\nAnother even longer study, which followed more than 21,000 twins in Finland, found that people who were regularly sleeping less than seven hours daily were 21% to 26% more likely to die of any cause during the study's 22-year period than those who slept more than eight hours.\n\nSo clearly sleep has some real biological benefit. Could it just be that the brain and body need downtime to recuperate after the activity of the day? That was the most popular explanation for decades, until an inquisitive neuroscientist at the University of Rochester decided to look for the answer inside the brain itself. When she did, Dr. Maiken Nedergaard uncovered what many scientists now agree is sleep's primary evolutionary function: to clean out the brain, quite literally, of accumulating debris.\n\nIn 2014, Nedergaard first revealed that while the body appears to rest during sleep, a whole lot is happening inside the brain. Neurons pulse with electrical signals that wash over the brain in a rhythmic flow. The brain runs checks on itself to ensure that the balance of hormones, enzymes and proteins isn't too far off-kilter. All the while, brain cells contract, opening up the spaces between them so that fluid can wash out the toxic detritus that can cause all kinds of problems if it builds up.\n\"It's like a dishwasher that keeps flushing through to wash the dirt away,\" Nedergaard says.\n\nWithout that nightly wash cycle, dangerous toxins can damage healthy cells and interfere with their ability to communicate with one another. In the short term, that can impede memory formation and the ability to coherently compose our thoughts and regulate our emotions. Over time, the consequences can be more dire.

That's why they also know that the cost of ignoring the latest science on sleep can be dear.\n\nSpending a good third of the day oblivious to the world around you and, by extension, incapable of protecting yourself doesn't seem like a smart way for a species to stay alive. And yet every animal does it, leading scientists to accept that sleep must be nonnegotiable for some reason\u2014and that we must need a certain amount of it to survive.\n\nFollowing a rigorous, milestone study in 2002 of more than 1 million healthy men and women by the American Cancer Society, experts suggested that the magic amount of sleep for longevity was seven hours a night. People who slept that amount were most likely to still be alive at the end of the study's six years, compared with people who got either six hours or less, or eight hours or more, of sleep each night. To this day, that's typically the amount that doctors and public-health groups recommend for the average adult, though older people can probably get away with a little less sleep than that, and younger people need more.\n\nAnother even longer study, which followed more than 21,000 twins in Finland, found that people who were regularly sleeping less than seven hours daily were 21% to 26% more likely to die of any cause during the study's 22-year period than those who slept more than eight hours.\n\nSo clearly sleep has some real biological benefit. Could it just be that the brain and body need downtime to recuperate after the activity of the day? That was the most popular explanation for decades, until an inquisitive neuroscientist at the University of Rochester decided to look for the answer inside the brain itself. When she did, Dr. Maiken Nedergaard uncovered what many scientists now agree is sleep's primary evolutionary function: to clean out the brain, quite literally, of accumulating debris.\n\nIn 2014, Nedergaard first revealed that while the body appears to rest during sleep, a whole lot is happening inside the brain. Neurons pulse with electrical signals that wash over the brain in a rhythmic flow. The brain runs checks on itself to ensure that the balance of hormones, enzymes and proteins isn't too far off-kilter. All the while, brain cells contract, opening up the spaces between them so that fluid can wash out the toxic detritus that can cause all kinds of problems if it builds up.\n\"It's like a dishwasher that keeps flushing through to wash the dirt away,\" Nedergaard says.\n\nWithout that nightly wash cycle, dangerous toxins can damage healthy cells and interfere with their ability to communicate with one another. In the short term, that can impede memory formation and the ability to coherently compose our thoughts and regulate our emotions. Over time, the consequences can be more dire. Lack of sleep can lead to faster aging of brain cells, contributing to diseases like Alzheimer's, which is now the cause of death for 1 in 3 seniors.\n\nNedergaard's research, which was done in mice, prompted a crucial rethinking of not only the benefits of sleep but also its biological function. It turns out the brain and body are extremely active when we sleep\u2014we're just not aware of most of what occurs while we do it.\n\n\"Sleep is not just a passive state but a fairly active state on the molecular level,\" says Dr. Allan Pack, director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology at the University of Pennsylvania. \"During the day, the brain is using energy resources to fire neurons. At night, a switch turns on so the sleeping brain can take advantage of the metabolic downtime to do some cleaning up.\"\n\nThe idea that sleep is a time of important biological activity, rather than a period when the body checks out, is transforming how doctors think about another important factor in longevity: mental health.\n\nScientists have long known that sleep is important for memory. But it turns out that during sleep, especially the cycles of deep dream sleep, the brain doesn't just revisit the events of a day in a more organized way. It also works on processing the emotions attached to these recollections. When a memory is filed away during sleep, it's also stripped of some of the powerful feelings\u2014like fear, grief, anger or joy\u2014that might have clouded the experiences in the heat of the moment.\n\nIt wouldn't be healthy, or efficient, to remember every event or experience in its full factual and emotional context. But separating the emotional aspects of a memory\u2014the anger over an argument with your spouse, the frustration at the guy who cut you off in traffic, the dejection you felt after getting a curt email reply from your boss\u2014from its objective parts allows you to recall the experience without reliving it. \"We sleep to remember and we sleep to forget,\" says Walker, the UC Berkeley sleep scientist, of this coping mechanism. \"I call it overnight therapy.\"\n\nThis type of processing takes time. It likely happens only during deep, quality sleep, and only over consistent nights of such sleep. That may explain why people who cut their sleep short or experience interrupted sleep may not fully disentangle the emotional baggage from their memories.\n\nIn those cases the memory, in its emotionally taxing entirety, continues to resurface every time the brain tries to sleep, in a vain effort to be properly processed. The brain tries to store the memory in a neutral way, but without deep sleep, there just isn't enough time for that triage.\n\nWalker believes these aborted efforts may drive conditions like PTSD, which is well understood to be common among combat veterans but which may be more common among the general population than therapists and researchers previously thought.\n\n\"The more nights you sleep, the more soothing the influence of sleep on that memory,\" he says. \"Sleep continues to work on those emotional memories and flatten them out after about a week. Now there's great evidence that PTSD is a disorder in which that process fails.\"\n\nWalker saw this effect firsthand when he showed a group of people a frightening video. He kept some of the people awake after the viewing and allowed the rest to sleep normally. Those who were not allowed to sleep properly were more likely to remember the negative aspects of the video than those who got enough sleep.\n\nThere's also strong support for the idea that insufficient sleep may be a trigger for, and not just a symptom of, a number of mental illnesses, including depression, bipolar disorder and even schizophrenia. Depriving people with bipolar disorder of sleep, for example, can launch a manic episode, while some people with depression report worsening symptoms when they aren't sleeping well.\n\nFully understanding the role sleep plays in mental illness is a rich area of future research. Already many doctors think consistent, high-quality sleep can have a direct bearing on the health of those with mental illness. \"Anyone who suffers from moderate or significant mental-health concerns needs to be aware that sleep may be one of the most important things they can do,\" says Walker.\n\nStress, scientists also know, is one of the more potent accelerators of aging, and a body that's not sleeping enough looks similar to one that's stressed out\u2014it's highly reactive to perceived threats, even when those threats don't pose any real risk. Biologically speaking, there's virtually no difference in the way a body reacts to a startling noise in the middle of the night, a rabid raccoon or a stressful work deadline: in all cases, fight-or-flight mode is triggered, blood pressure spikes, breathing gets shallow, and the heart starts to race. That's what happens to a body on no sleep too.\n\nThose stress reactions can be useful, of course: they help you respond more readily to an actual physical threat. But that's not usually what's going on. And staying in an alert mode can trigger a number of unhealthy conditions, the most damaging of which is inflammation.\n\nInflammation is the body's natural defense system against injury or invading microbes like bacteria and viruses. It's why your toe turns red and throbs when you stub it or when it's infected: white blood cells rush to the area in order to protect it for the short time it's needed to help you get better. But inflammation can also become chronic, and that's when the real trouble starts.\n\nChronic inflammation, doctors now know, is a leading driver of many diseases, including some cancers, cognitive decline, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes\u2014even chronic pain. And one of the main drivers of chronic inflammation is, of course, not sleeping enough.\n\nGetting a decent night's sleep, then, is good advice for all of us. Americans spent an estimated $41 billion on sleeping pills and other sleep aids in 2015; no matter how much we may boast about our stamina, we know intuitively that we need sleep, even if we don't always know why.\n\nBut scientists do. That's why experts are insisting, with increasing frequency and noise, that sleep be a priority\u2014as important or more than what you eat and how much you exercise. We wouldn't dream of skipping meals on a regular basis, so why skimp on sleep?\n\nThere's still much about sleep that mystifies scientists\u2014particularly about what goes wrong for so many of us, night after night. But as they chip away at the underlying causes of sleeplessness, they get ever closer to a cure. Harvard's Zielinski, for one, is hopeful that they will eventually find a way to help more people sleep better every night.When he gave his sleepless mice a drug to fix the mutation that was interfering with their sleep in the first place, they began to slumber anew.", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1736:c872c493-c12a-4a5e-8d34-accf0ec04df1", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "f3c96735b1259b516d88bd87c030608333260e2bef8d68d2daea2b524b8d9588", "id": 83, "metadata": {"article_number": "1736", "filename": "1736SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "0ab01231-2f3c-40a4-b791-ed0fa65208ab", "topic_number": 0, "glossary": {}, "name": "Quoted Sources", "instructions": "Use the 'Quoted Sources' label to highlight BOTH the names of anyone (person or organization) quoted or paraphrased in the article AND the quote or paraphrase itself.

But Zielinski, who teaches psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, had recently tweaked their schedule to keep the mice up past their bedtime.\n\nZielinski and his colleagues would rustle the bedding in the mice's cages to keep them from dozing off when they started to display the telltale signs of sleepiness\u2014drooping lids, sluggish walk, EEG readings showing their brain activity was waning. But Zielinski noticed that when the mice were left alone to slumber at will after the disruption, they didn't, or perhaps couldn't, fall asleep.\n\nThat the sleep-deprived rodents slept less than they normally would didn't really surprise Zielinski. The mice had a genetic mutation that he suspected was linked to sleep problems. More striking were the electrical brain readings showing that even when they did sleep, they weren't getting the deep, restorative kind of rest that doctors say matters most\u2014not just to rodents but also to humans.\n\nIn the right conditions, researchers believe, the brain produces a signal that essentially tells the body's major systems\u2014the heart, the lungs, the digestive system, the nervous system, even the muscles\u2014that it's time to call it quits for the day. Zielinski's research has found that, just as with the mice with the mutation, it's likely that in some people with chronic sleep problems, that critical signal isn't firing.\n\nUnderstanding what's behind some forms of insomnia, an aim of Zielinski's research, is a major step in learning how to fix it. That's a big deal in sleep research, because evidence linking quality rest to good health and longevity has never been more convincing.\n\nScientists are learning that shortchanging sleep can compromise nearly every major body system, from the brain to the heart to the immune system, making our inability\u2014or unwillingness\u2014to sleep enough one of the unhealthiest things we can do.\nStudies of people whose sleep sessions are irregular or short show they are at higher risk of developing diseases that can lead to early death, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. Poor sleep may have detrimental effects on the brain as well, increasing the risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, as well as mood disorders like depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. And like smoking, a terrible diet and not exercising enough, poor sleep is now linked to an overall increased risk of premature death.\n\n\"I used to suggest that sleep is the third pillar of good health, along with diet and exercise,\" says Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. \"But I don't agree with that anymore. Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do to reset your brain and body for health.\"\nDespite the mounting evidence of its benefits, Americans are sleeping about two hours less each night than they did a century ago. Blame the technology-fueled 24/7 workplace, social media or the relentless news cycle, but about one-third of U.S. adults sleep less than the recommended seven hours daily, and 40% report feeling drowsy during the day, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The problem begins early: only 15% to 30% of U.S. teens get the 8\u00bd hours a night recommended for adolescents.\n\nWhile life expectancy has been inching upward over the past century thanks to advances in medicine and technology, those gains could start to sag under the weight of our collective sleeplessness. Many people still dismiss sleep as something they can occasionally (or even regularly) skimp on, but the biological facts are clear: it is neither safe nor wise to take sleep lightly.\n\n\"To me, sleep is like the canary in the coal mine,\" says David Schnyer, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Texas, Austin. \"Changes in sleep can create systemwide changes in the organism, and all of the stages of sleep affect the entire body and brain.\"\n\nThat's why sleep deprivation is so strongly linked to disease and premature death. One recent study even showed that sleep deprivation in mice can cause death faster than starvation can. And yet doctors\u2014those who talk to their patients about sleep in the first place, anyway\u2014report that many people still aren't convinced that their nightly rest is a critical piece of the long-life puzzle. Health obsessives who would never touch a cigarette and pride themselves on avoiding junk food may also boast about how much they get done, and how little they sleep at night.\n\n\"Because we're asleep, we don't see the benefits of it,\" says Robert Stickgold, a well-known sleep researcher and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. \"That's the disaster and tragedy of our current world.\"\n\nIt's been that way for a long time. Benjamin Franklin famously quipped that \"there will be sleeping enough in the grave,\" and today, sleep is still misperceived as one of the most duty-driven and unproductive parts of the day\u2014the habit that gets in the way of life as opposed to the one most likely to extend it.\n\nPerhaps that's because until very recently, scientists couldn't even agree on the evolutionary reason why animals need to sleep in the first place. But now they know that what happens during sleep, particularly in the brain, is critical to human well-being\u2014not to mention a long life. That's why they also know that the cost of ignoring the latest science on sleep can be dear.\n\nSpending a good third of the day oblivious to the world around you and, by extension, incapable of protecting yourself doesn't seem like a smart way for a species to stay alive. And yet every animal does it, leading scientists to accept that sleep must be nonnegotiable for some reason\u2014and that we must need a certain amount of it to survive.\n\nFollowing a rigorous, milestone study in 2002 of more than 1 million healthy men and women by the American Cancer Society, experts suggested that the magic amount of sleep for longevity was seven hours a night. People who slept that amount were most likely to still be alive at the end of the study's six years, compared with people who got either six hours or less, or eight hours or more, of sleep each night. To this day, that's typically the amount that doctors and public-health groups recommend for the average adult, though older people can probably get away with a little less sleep than that, and younger people need more.\n\nAnother even longer study, which followed more than 21,000 twins in Finland, found that people who were regularly sleeping less than seven hours daily were 21% to 26% more likely to die of any cause during the study's 22-year period than those who slept more than eight hours.\n\nSo clearly sleep has some real biological benefit. Could it just be that the brain and body need downtime to recuperate after the activity of the day? That was the most popular explanation for decades, until an inquisitive neuroscientist at the University of Rochester decided to look for the answer inside the brain itself. When she did, Dr. Maiken Nedergaard uncovered what many scientists now agree is sleep's primary evolutionary function: to clean out the brain, quite literally, of accumulating debris.\n\nIn 2014, Nedergaard first revealed that while the body appears to rest during sleep, a whole lot is happening inside the brain. Neurons pulse with electrical signals that wash over the brain in a rhythmic flow. The brain runs checks on itself to ensure that the balance of hormones, enzymes and proteins isn't too far off-kilter. All the while, brain cells contract, opening up the spaces between them so that fluid can wash out the toxic detritus that can cause all kinds of problems if it builds up.\n\"It's like a dishwasher that keeps flushing through to wash the dirt away,\" Nedergaard says.\n\nWithout that nightly wash cycle, dangerous toxins can damage healthy cells and interfere with their ability to communicate with one another. In the short term, that can impede memory formation and the ability to coherently compose our thoughts and regulate our emotions. Over time, the consequences can be more dire. Lack of sleep can lead to faster aging of brain cells, contributing to diseases like Alzheimer's, which is now the cause of death for 1 in 3 seniors.\n\nNedergaard's research, which was done in mice, prompted a crucial rethinking of not only the benefits of sleep but also its biological function. It turns out the brain and body are extremely active when we sleep\u2014we're just not aware of most of what occurs while we do it.\n\n\"Sleep is not just a passive state but a fairly active state on the molecular level,\" says Dr. Allan Pack, director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology at the University of Pennsylvania. \"During the day, the brain is using energy resources to fire neurons. At night, a switch turns on so the sleeping brain can take advantage of the metabolic downtime to do some cleaning up.\"\n\nThe idea that sleep is a time of important biological activity, rather than a period when the body checks out, is transforming how doctors think about another important factor in longevity: mental health.\n\nScientists have long known that sleep is important for memory. But it turns out that during sleep, especially the cycles of deep dream sleep, the brain doesn't just revisit the events of a day in a more organized way. It also works on processing the emotions attached to these recollections. When a memory is filed away during sleep, it's also stripped of some of the powerful feelings\u2014like fear, grief, anger or joy\u2014that might have clouded the experiences in the heat of the moment.\n\nIt wouldn't be healthy, or efficient, to remember every event or experience in its full factual and emotional context. But separating the emotional aspects of a memory\u2014the anger over an argument with your spouse, the frustration at the guy who cut you off in traffic, the dejection you felt after getting a curt email reply from your boss\u2014from its objective parts allows you to recall the experience without reliving it. \"We sleep to remember and we sleep to forget,\" says Walker, the UC Berkeley sleep scientist, of this coping mechanism. \"I call it overnight therapy.\"\n\nThis type of processing takes time. It likely happens only during deep, quality sleep, and only over consistent nights of such sleep. That may explain why people who cut their sleep short or experience interrupted sleep may not fully disentangle the emotional baggage from their memories.\n\nIn those cases the memory, in its emotionally taxing entirety, continues to resurface every time the brain tries to sleep, in a vain effort to be properly processed. The brain tries to store the memory in a neutral way, but without deep sleep, there just isn't enough time for that triage.\n\nWalker believes these aborted efforts may drive conditions like PTSD, which is well understood to be common among combat veterans but which may be more common among the general population than therapists and researchers previously thought.\n\n\"The more nights you sleep, the more soothing the influence of sleep on that memory,\" he says. \"Sleep continues to work on those emotional memories and flatten them out after about a week. Now there's great evidence that PTSD is a disorder in which that process fails.\"\n\nWalker saw this effect firsthand when he showed a group of people a frightening video. He kept some of the people awake after the viewing and allowed the rest to sleep normally. Those who were not allowed to sleep properly were more likely to remember the negative aspects of the video than those who got enough sleep.\n\nThere's also strong support for the idea that insufficient sleep may be a trigger for, and not just a symptom of, a number of mental illnesses, including depression, bipolar disorder and even schizophrenia. Depriving people with bipolar disorder of sleep, for example, can launch a manic episode, while some people with depression report worsening symptoms when they aren't sleeping well.\n\nFully understanding the role sleep plays in mental illness is a rich area of future research. Already many doctors think consistent, high-quality sleep can have a direct bearing on the health of those with mental illness. \"Anyone who suffers from moderate or significant mental-health concerns needs to be aware that sleep may be one of the most important things they can do,\" says Walker.\n\nStress, scientists also know, is one of the more potent accelerators of aging, and a body that's not sleeping enough looks similar to one that's stressed out\u2014it's highly reactive to perceived threats, even when those threats don't pose any real risk. Biologically speaking, there's virtually no difference in the way a body reacts to a startling noise in the middle of the night, a rabid raccoon or a stressful work deadline: in all cases, fight-or-flight mode is triggered, blood pressure spikes, breathing gets shallow, and the heart starts to race. That's what happens to a body on no sleep too.\n\nThose stress reactions can be useful, of course: they help you respond more readily to an actual physical threat. But that's not usually what's going on. And staying in an alert mode can trigger a number of unhealthy conditions, the most damaging of which is inflammation.\n\nInflammation is the body's natural defense system against injury or invading microbes like bacteria and viruses. It's why your toe turns red and throbs when you stub it or when it's infected: white blood cells rush to the area in order to protect it for the short time it's needed to help you get better. But inflammation can also become chronic, and that's when the real trouble starts.\n\nChronic inflammation, doctors now know, is a leading driver of many diseases, including some cancers, cognitive decline, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes\u2014even chronic pain. And one of the main drivers of chronic inflammation is, of course, not sleeping enough.\n\nGetting a decent night's sleep, then, is good advice for all of us. Americans spent an estimated $41 billion on sleeping pills and other sleep aids in 2015; no matter how much we may boast about our stamina, we know intuitively that we need sleep, even if we don't always know why.\n\nBut scientists do. That's why experts are insisting, with increasing frequency and noise, that sleep be a priority\u2014as important or more than what you eat and how much you exercise. We wouldn't dream of skipping meals on a regular basis, so why skimp on sleep?\n\nThere's still much about sleep that mystifies scientists\u2014particularly about what goes wrong for so many of us, night after night. But as they chip away at the underlying causes of sleeplessness, they get ever closer to a cure. Harvard's Zielinski, for one, is hopeful that they will eventually find a way to help more people sleep better every night.When he gave his sleepless mice a drug to fix the mutation that was interfering with their sleep in the first place, they began to slumber anew.", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1736:c872c493-c12a-4a5e-8d34-accf0ec04df1", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "f3c96735b1259b516d88bd87c030608333260e2bef8d68d2daea2b524b8d9588", "id": 83, "metadata": {"article_number": "1736", "filename": "1736SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "09ddb788-c3a6-44e5-a8c2-b6591d4a1f13", "topic_number": 0, "glossary": {}, "name": "Reasoning", "instructions": "Use the \u2018Reasoning\u2019 label on phrases and sentences that include specific and identifiable cognitive biases, psychological biases, argumentative fallacies, or logical errors.

The brain tries to store the memory in a neutral way, but without deep sleep, there just isn't enough time for that triage.\n\nWalker believes these aborted efforts may drive conditions like PTSD, which is well understood to be common among combat veterans but which may be more common among the general population than therapists and researchers previously thought.\n\n\"The more nights you sleep, the more soothing the influence of sleep on that memory,\" he says. \"Sleep continues to work on those emotional memories and flatten them out after about a week. Now there's great evidence that PTSD is a disorder in which that process fails.\"\n\nWalker saw this effect firsthand when he showed a group of people a frightening video. He kept some of the people awake after the viewing and allowed the rest to sleep normally. Those who were not allowed to sleep properly were more likely to remember the negative aspects of the video than those who got enough sleep.\n\nThere's also strong support for the idea that insufficient sleep may be a trigger for, and not just a symptom of, a number of mental illnesses, including depression, bipolar disorder and even schizophrenia. Depriving people with bipolar disorder of sleep, for example, can launch a manic episode, while some people with depression report worsening symptoms when they aren't sleeping well.\n\nFully understanding the role sleep plays in mental illness is a rich area of future research. Already many doctors think consistent, high-quality sleep can have a direct bearing on the health of those with mental illness. \"Anyone who suffers from moderate or significant mental-health concerns needs to be aware that sleep may be one of the most important things they can do,\" says Walker.\n\nStress, scientists also know, is one of the more potent accelerators of aging, and a body that's not sleeping enough looks similar to one that's stressed out\u2014it's highly reactive to perceived threats, even when those threats don't pose any real risk. Biologically speaking, there's virtually no difference in the way a body reacts to a startling noise in the middle of the night, a rabid raccoon or a stressful work deadline: in all cases, fight-or-flight mode is triggered, blood pressure spikes, breathing gets shallow, and the heart starts to race. That's what happens to a body on no sleep too.\n\nThose stress reactions can be useful, of course: they help you respond more readily to an actual physical threat. But that's not usually what's going on. And staying in an alert mode can trigger a number of unhealthy conditions, the most damaging of which is inflammation.\n\nInflammation is the body's natural defense system against injury or invading microbes like bacteria and viruses. It's why your toe turns red and throbs when you stub it or when it's infected: white blood cells rush to the area in order to protect it for the short time it's needed to help you get better. But inflammation can also become chronic, and that's when the real trouble starts.\n\nChronic inflammation, doctors now know, is a leading driver of many diseases, including some cancers, cognitive decline, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes\u2014even chronic pain. And one of the main drivers of chronic inflammation is, of course, not sleeping enough.\n\nGetting a decent night's sleep, then, is good advice for all of us. Americans spent an estimated $41 billion on sleeping pills and other sleep aids in 2015; no matter how much we may boast about our stamina, we know intuitively that we need sleep, even if we don't always know why.\n\nBut scientists do. That's why experts are insisting, with increasing frequency and noise, that sleep be a priority\u2014as important or more than what you eat and how much you exercise. We wouldn't dream of skipping meals on a regular basis, so why skimp on sleep?\n\nThere's still much about sleep that mystifies scientists\u2014particularly about what goes wrong for so many of us, night after night. But as they chip away at the underlying causes of sleeplessness, they get ever closer to a cure. Harvard's Zielinski, for one, is hopeful that they will eventually find a way to help more people sleep better every night.When he gave his sleepless mice a drug to fix the mutation that was interfering with their sleep in the first place, they began to slumber anew.", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1736:c872c493-c12a-4a5e-8d34-accf0ec04df1", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "f3c96735b1259b516d88bd87c030608333260e2bef8d68d2daea2b524b8d9588", "id": 83, "metadata": {"article_number": "1736", "filename": "1736SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "d1c04ecf-3302-4584-88a4-184000da3cf5", "topic_number": 1, "glossary": {}, "name": "Fact-check", "instructions": "Highlight claims that are worth the effort of fact-checking.

Normally, the animals woke and slept on a 12-hour cycle. When the lights were on in the lab, the mice were active. When it went dark on a timer, down they went. But Zielinski, who teaches psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, had recently tweaked their schedule to keep the mice up past their bedtime.\n\nZielinski and his colleagues would rustle the bedding in the mice's cages to keep them from dozing off when they started to display the telltale signs of sleepiness\u2014drooping lids, sluggish walk, EEG readings showing their brain activity was waning. But Zielinski noticed that when the mice were left alone to slumber at will after the disruption, they didn't, or perhaps couldn't, fall asleep.\n\nThat the sleep-deprived rodents slept less than they normally would didn't really surprise Zielinski. The mice had a genetic mutation that he suspected was linked to sleep problems. More striking were the electrical brain readings showing that even when they did sleep, they weren't getting the deep, restorative kind of rest that doctors say matters most\u2014not just to rodents but also to humans.\n\nIn the right conditions, researchers believe, the brain produces a signal that essentially tells the body's major systems\u2014the heart, the lungs, the digestive system, the nervous system, even the muscles\u2014that it's time to call it quits for the day. Zielinski's research has found that, just as with the mice with the mutation, it's likely that in some people with chronic sleep problems, that critical signal isn't firing.\n\nUnderstanding what's behind some forms of insomnia, an aim of Zielinski's research, is a major step in learning how to fix it. That's a big deal in sleep research, because evidence linking quality rest to good health and longevity has never been more convincing.\n\nScientists are learning that shortchanging sleep can compromise nearly every major body system, from the brain to the heart to the immune system, making our inability\u2014or unwillingness\u2014to sleep enough one of the unhealthiest things we can do.\nStudies of people whose sleep sessions are irregular or short show they are at higher risk of developing diseases that can lead to early death, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. Poor sleep may have detrimental effects on the brain as well, increasing the risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, as well as mood disorders like depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. And like smoking, a terrible diet and not exercising enough, poor sleep is now linked to an overall increased risk of premature death.\n\n\"I used to suggest that sleep is the third pillar of good health, along with diet and exercise,\" says Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. \"But I don't agree with that anymore. Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do to reset your brain and body for health.\"\nDespite the mounting evidence of its benefits, Americans are sleeping about two hours less each night than they did a century ago. Blame the technology-fueled 24/7 workplace, social media or the relentless news cycle, but about one-third of U.S. adults sleep less than the recommended seven hours daily, and 40% report feeling drowsy during the day, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The problem begins early: only 15% to 30% of U.S. teens get the 8\u00bd hours a night recommended for adolescents.\n\nWhile life expectancy has been inching upward over the past century thanks to advances in medicine and technology, those gains could start to sag under the weight of our collective sleeplessness. Many people still dismiss sleep as something they can occasionally (or even regularly) skimp on, but the biological facts are clear: it is neither safe nor wise to take sleep lightly.\n\n\"To me, sleep is like the canary in the coal mine,\" says David Schnyer, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Texas, Austin. \"Changes in sleep can create systemwide changes in the organism, and all of the stages of sleep affect the entire body and brain.\"\n\nThat's why sleep deprivation is so strongly linked to disease and premature death. One recent study even showed that sleep deprivation in mice can cause death faster than starvation can. And yet doctors\u2014those who talk to their patients about sleep in the first place, anyway\u2014report that many people still aren't convinced that their nightly rest is a critical piece of the long-life puzzle. Health obsessives who would never touch a cigarette and pride themselves on avoiding junk food may also boast about how much they get done, and how little they sleep at night.\n\n\"Because we're asleep, we don't see the benefits of it,\" says Robert Stickgold, a well-known sleep researcher and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. \"That's the disaster and tragedy of our current world.\"\n\nIt's been that way for a long time. Benjamin Franklin famously quipped that \"there will be sleeping enough in the grave,\" and today, sleep is still misperceived as one of the most duty-driven and unproductive parts of the day\u2014the habit that gets in the way of life as opposed to the one most likely to extend it.\n\nPerhaps that's because until very recently, scientists couldn't even agree on the evolutionary reason why animals need to sleep in the first place. But now they know that what happens during sleep, particularly in the brain, is critical to human well-being\u2014not to mention a long life. That's why they also know that the cost of ignoring the latest science on sleep can be dear.\n\nSpending a good third of the day oblivious to the world around you and, by extension, incapable of protecting yourself doesn't seem like a smart way for a species to stay alive. And yet every animal does it, leading scientists to accept that sleep must be nonnegotiable for some reason\u2014and that we must need a certain amount of it to survive.\n\nFollowing a rigorous, milestone study in 2002 of more than 1 million healthy men and women by the American Cancer Society, experts suggested that the magic amount of sleep for longevity was seven hours a night. People who slept that amount were most likely to still be alive at the end of the study's six years, compared with people who got either six hours or less, or eight hours or more, of sleep each night. To this day, that's typically the amount that doctors and public-health groups recommend for the average adult, though older people can probably get away with a little less sleep than that, and younger people need more.\n\nAnother even longer study, which followed more than 21,000 twins in Finland, found that people who were regularly sleeping less than seven hours daily were 21% to 26% more likely to die of any cause during the study's 22-year period than those who slept more than eight hours.\n\nSo clearly sleep has some real biological benefit. Could it just be that the brain and body need downtime to recuperate after the activity of the day? That was the most popular explanation for decades, until an inquisitive neuroscientist at the University of Rochester decided to look for the answer inside the brain itself. When she did, Dr. Maiken Nedergaard uncovered what many scientists now agree is sleep's primary evolutionary function: to clean out the brain, quite literally, of accumulating debris.\n\nIn 2014, Nedergaard first revealed that while the body appears to rest during sleep, a whole lot is happening inside the brain. Neurons pulse with electrical signals that wash over the brain in a rhythmic flow. The brain runs checks on itself to ensure that the balance of hormones, enzymes and proteins isn't too far off-kilter. All the while, brain cells contract, opening up the spaces between them so that fluid can wash out the toxic detritus that can cause all kinds of problems if it builds up.\n\"It's like a dishwasher that keeps flushing through to wash the dirt away,\" Nedergaard says.\n\nWithout that nightly wash cycle, dangerous toxins can damage healthy cells and interfere with their ability to communicate with one another. In the short term, that can impede memory formation and the ability to coherently compose our thoughts and regulate our emotions. Over time, the consequences can be more dire. Lack of sleep can lead to faster aging of brain cells, contributing to diseases like Alzheimer's, which is now the cause of death for 1 in 3 seniors.\n\nNedergaard's research, which was done in mice, prompted a crucial rethinking of not only the benefits of sleep but also its biological function. It turns out the brain and body are extremely active when we sleep\u2014we're just not aware of most of what occurs while we do it.\n\n\"Sleep is not just a passive state but a fairly active state on the molecular level,\" says Dr. Allan Pack, director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology at the University of Pennsylvania. \"During the day, the brain is using energy resources to fire neurons. At night, a switch turns on so the sleeping brain can take advantage of the metabolic downtime to do some cleaning up.\"\n\nThe idea that sleep is a time of important biological activity, rather than a period when the body checks out, is transforming how doctors think about another important factor in longevity: mental health.\n\nScientists have long known that sleep is important for memory. But it turns out that during sleep, especially the cycles of deep dream sleep, the brain doesn't just revisit the events of a day in a more organized way. It also works on processing the emotions attached to these recollections. When a memory is filed away during sleep, it's also stripped of some of the powerful feelings\u2014like fear, grief, anger or joy\u2014that might have clouded the experiences in the heat of the moment.\n\nIt wouldn't be healthy, or efficient, to remember every event or experience in its full factual and emotional context. But separating the emotional aspects of a memory\u2014the anger over an argument with your spouse, the frustration at the guy who cut you off in traffic, the dejection you felt after getting a curt email reply from your boss\u2014from its objective parts allows you to recall the experience without reliving it. \"We sleep to remember and we sleep to forget,\" says Walker, the UC Berkeley sleep scientist, of this coping mechanism. \"I call it overnight therapy.\"\n\nThis type of processing takes time. It likely happens only during deep, quality sleep, and only over consistent nights of such sleep. That may explain why people who cut their sleep short or experience interrupted sleep may not fully disentangle the emotional baggage from their memories.\n\nIn those cases the memory, in its emotionally taxing entirety, continues to resurface every time the brain tries to sleep, in a vain effort to be properly processed. The brain tries to store the memory in a neutral way, but without deep sleep, there just isn't enough time for that triage.\n\nWalker believes these aborted efforts may drive conditions like PTSD, which is well understood to be common among combat veterans but which may be more common among the general population than therapists and researchers previously thought.\n\n\"The more nights you sleep, the more soothing the influence of sleep on that memory,\" he says. \"Sleep continues to work on those emotional memories and flatten them out after about a week. Now there's great evidence that PTSD is a disorder in which that process fails.\"\n\nWalker saw this effect firsthand when he showed a group of people a frightening video. He kept some of the people awake after the viewing and allowed the rest to sleep normally. Those who were not allowed to sleep properly were more likely to remember the negative aspects of the video than those who got enough sleep.\n\nThere's also strong support for the idea that insufficient sleep may be a trigger for, and not just a symptom of, a number of mental illnesses, including depression, bipolar disorder and even schizophrenia. Depriving people with bipolar disorder of sleep, for example, can launch a manic episode, while some people with depression report worsening symptoms when they aren't sleeping well.\n\nFully understanding the role sleep plays in mental illness is a rich area of future research. Already many doctors think consistent, high-quality sleep can have a direct bearing on the health of those with mental illness. \"Anyone who suffers from moderate or significant mental-health concerns needs to be aware that sleep may be one of the most important things they can do,\" says Walker.\n\nStress, scientists also know, is one of the more potent accelerators of aging, and a body that's not sleeping enough looks similar to one that's stressed out\u2014it's highly reactive to perceived threats, even when those threats don't pose any real risk.

It\u2019s Also Invisible.\n\nauthor: Chris Herring\n\nDate: FEB. 15, 2017\n\nIt\u2019s nothing new to hear the San Antonio Spurs described as machinelike. But far too often that label seems to focus solely on the team\u2019s offensive precision as opposed to the club\u2019s perennially outstanding defense.\n\nNo team over the past two decades has been better at getting stops than the Spurs, who not only stand as the NBA\u2019s best defense this year, but have ranked among the top 10 in defensive efficiency in 17 of the past 20 seasons.\n\nIn particular, dating back to last season, the Spurs have been fantastic at taking away corner 3-pointers, arguably the most valuable shot in basketball. But is some of that due to sheer luck?\n\nSan Antonio, after holding opponents to 33 percent from the corners last season (second best, behind the Clippers), is limiting foes to an NBA-low 33 percent again this season. Seems simple enough! Yet those gaudy numbers are harder to explain when you look closely at another set of numbers: The Spurs are often nowhere to be found when opposing teams take corner 3\u2019s. Last year, according to data compiled by SportVU client manager Matt Scott at FiveThirtyEight\u2019s request, the Spurs contested 35 percent of corner 3\u2019s, seventh-lowest in the league; this year, they\u2019re third from the bottom with a similar rate.\n\n[Graph: The Spurs defense: Better lucky than good? Share of corner 3-pointers contested by a team\u2019s defense vs. star made by their opponent, 2016-17 season so far, showing Spurs are an outlier]\n\nUnlike when the Spurs played in the cavernous Alamodome, where players complained about struggling with depth perception, there isn\u2019t a clear explanation as to how the Spurs defend corner 3\u2019s so much better than other teams without actually defending them.\n\nBut while the numbers may represent an aberration \u2014 there\u2019s an intelligent argument to be made that 3-point defense is somewhat random \u2014 a couple of things could explain how San Antonio has avoided getting burned from the corners. Last season, for example, the Spurs played in a division where the majority of the teams were among the NBA\u2019s worst at connecting on corner 3-point tries. That meant they got to play against Memphis (worst), New Orleans (third-worst) and Houston (ninth-worst) four times each, whereas the majority of clubs wouldn\u2019t have had that same opportunity. (Still, that wouldn\u2019t explain this season, given that the Rockets, Pelicans and Mavericks are all hitting corner 3s at about league-average rates, while the Grizzlies rank third best in the NBA in the category so far.)\n\nBeyond that, there\u2019s also the fact that San Antonio\u2019s players are tied for the league lead in terms of how fast they move on defense, according to SportVU\u2019s tracking, perhaps forcing opposing players to pull the trigger a split-second sooner than they otherwise would.

It\u2019s Also Invisible.\n\nauthor: Chris Herring\n\nDate: FEB. 15, 2017\n\nIt\u2019s nothing new to hear the San Antonio Spurs described as machinelike. But far too often that label seems to focus solely on the team\u2019s offensive precision as opposed to the club\u2019s perennially outstanding defense.\n\nNo team over the past two decades has been better at getting stops than the Spurs, who not only stand as the NBA\u2019s best defense this year, but have ranked among the top 10 in defensive efficiency in 17 of the past 20 seasons.\n\nIn particular, dating back to last season, the Spurs have been fantastic at taking away corner 3-pointers, arguably the most valuable shot in basketball. But is some of that due to sheer luck?\n\nSan Antonio, after holding opponents to 33 percent from the corners last season (second best, behind the Clippers), is limiting foes to an NBA-low 33 percent again this season. Seems simple enough! Yet those gaudy numbers are harder to explain when you look closely at another set of numbers: The Spurs are often nowhere to be found when opposing teams take corner 3\u2019s. Last year, according to data compiled by SportVU client manager Matt Scott at FiveThirtyEight\u2019s request, the Spurs contested 35 percent of corner 3\u2019s, seventh-lowest in the league; this year, they\u2019re third from the bottom with a similar rate.\n\n[Graph: The Spurs defense: Better lucky than good? Share of corner 3-pointers contested by a team\u2019s defense vs. star made by their opponent, 2016-17 season so far, showing Spurs are an outlier]\n\nUnlike when the Spurs played in the cavernous Alamodome, where players complained about struggling with depth perception, there isn\u2019t a clear explanation as to how the Spurs defend corner 3\u2019s so much better than other teams without actually defending them.\n\nBut while the numbers may represent an aberration \u2014 there\u2019s an intelligent argument to be made that 3-point defense is somewhat random \u2014 a couple of things could explain how San Antonio has avoided getting burned from the corners.

Credit Jennifer Sens for The New York Times\nDuring her pregnancy, she never drank alcohol or had a cigarette. But nearly every day, Stacey, then 24, smoked marijuana.\n\nWith her fianc\u00e9\u2019s blessing, she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell morning sickness before going to work at a sandwich shop. When sciatica made it unbearable to stand during her 12-hour shifts, she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily say, \u2018Go smoke a pound of pot when you\u2019re pregnant,\u2019\u201d said Stacey, now a stay-at-home mother in Deltona, Fla., who asked that her full name be withheld because street-bought marijuana is illegal in Florida. \u201cIn moderation, it\u2019s O.K.\u201d\n\nMany pregnant women, particularly younger ones, seem to agree, a recent federal survey shows. As states legalize marijuana or its medical use, expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers \u2014 another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health.\n\nA Balm When You\u2019re Expecting: Sometimes Pot Does the Trick FEB. 20, 2017\n\nPET CITY\nDogs on Marijuana: Not Cool FEB. 2, 2017\n\nPets on Pot: The Newest Customer Base for Medical Marijuana OCT. 8, 2016\n\nCalifornians Legalize Marijuana in Vote That Could Echo Nationally NOV. 9, 2016\n\nD.E.A. Keeps Marijuana on List of Dangerous Drugs, Frustrating Advocates AUG. 11, 2016\nAdvertisement\n\nOften pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants. But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana\u2019s main psychoactive ingredient \u2014 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC \u2014 can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk.\n\n\u201cThere is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it\u2019s actually safe,\u201d said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use.\n\nIn the federal survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of mothers-to-be said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2.4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.)\n\n[Photo]\n\nStacey\u2019s son just had his first birthday. He\u2019s walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn\u2019t worried about his development. Credit Jennifer Sens for The New York Times\nYoung mothers-to-be were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7.5 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44.\n\nEvidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, 6-year-olds born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention.\n\nMost troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers.\n\n\u201cPrenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,\u201d said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nSeveral studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use.

Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n\u201cAll those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren\u2019t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,\u201d said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington\u2019s fetal alcohol and drug unit. \u201cWe need to do a whole lot more research now.\u201d\n\nThere are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use. Research is often based on reports by pregnant women \u2014 instead of, say, tests of urine or the umbilical cord \u2014 and they consistently underreport their use. (Researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies.) And pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol; it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself.\n\nFew realize that THC is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother\u2019s body for weeks, if not months. It\u2019s not known whether the fetus\u2019s exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit.\n\nTo find out whether that\u2019s happening, Dr. Judy Chang, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients.\n\nMedical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana, the researchers found, than to advise them of potential risks. When mothers-to-be admitted to marijuana use, almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all.\n\nPregnant women aren\u2019t eager to discuss it, either, because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture.\n\nDepression, anxiety, stress, pain, nausea and vomiting were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 survey of low-income mothers getting federal nutrition help in Colorado. Roughly 6 percent were pot users; a third were pregnant.\n\n\u201cWomen are thinking of this as medical marijuana in that they are treating some condition,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute who researches substance abuse in pregnancy.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to consider it like medicine,\u201d she said, \u201cthen treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it.\u201d\n\nStacey\u2019s son just had his first birthday. He\u2019s walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn\u2019t worried about his development.\n\nShe still smokes pot \u2014 indeed, her son plays on a rug emblazoned with a marijuana leaf. But the severe cramps that plagued her before pregnancy are easing now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to smoke as much anymore,\u201d she said.", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1739:5b14d080-cbf5-4700-919f-b1bc740828ac", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "a6a4d058630efccca1ce1f7e636ca8f3e392460db4e62c2280617edc9b209be0", "id": 86, "metadata": {"article_number": "1739", "filename": "1739SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "0ab01231-2f3c-40a4-b791-ed0fa65208ab", "topic_number": 0, "glossary": {}, "name": "Quoted Sources", "instructions": "Use the 'Quoted Sources' label to highlight BOTH the names of anyone (person or organization) quoted or paraphrased in the article AND the quote or paraphrase itself.

Keeps Marijuana on List of Dangerous Drugs, Frustrating Advocates AUG. 11, 2016\nAdvertisement\n\nOften pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants. But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana\u2019s main psychoactive ingredient \u2014 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC \u2014 can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk.\n\n\u201cThere is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it\u2019s actually safe,\u201d said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use.\n\nIn the federal survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of mothers-to-be said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2.4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.)\n\n[Photo]\n\nStacey\u2019s son just had his first birthday. He\u2019s walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn\u2019t worried about his development. Credit Jennifer Sens for The New York Times\nYoung mothers-to-be were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7.5 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44.\n\nEvidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, 6-year-olds born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention.\n\nMost troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers.\n\n\u201cPrenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,\u201d said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nSeveral studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion.\n\n\u201cEven early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,\u201d said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. \u201cThose are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition.\u201d\n\nIt is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even eventually reducing I.Q.\n\n\u201cThe effects are not dramatic, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are not important,\u201d said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. \u201cIt could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,\u201d she added.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement. But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic.\n\nOf five federal agencies, only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February, according to a study published online in December in the journal Substance Abuse. Only 10 state health departments did.\n\nUntil recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered nothing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think public health officials should be alarming people,\u201d said Marian Jarlenski, the study\u2019s lead author and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. \u201cThey just have to say, \u2018There have been studies done, and there is some risk.\u2019\u201d\n\nGet the best of Well, with the latest on health, fitness and nutrition, delivered to your inbox every week.\n\nYou agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.\n\nSEE SAMPLE PRIVACY POLICY OPT OUT OR CONTACT US ANYTIME\nIn a statement, C.D.C. officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to THC in utero.\n\n\u201cWhile current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent, some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy, such as low birth weight or preterm birth,\u201d the agency said.\n\nDr. Marie McCormick, a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new report on cannabis from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, said smoking cannabis \u201cdoes confer, in terms of birth weight, the same risk as cigarettes.\u201d\n\nSome of the gathering evidence is reassuring. So far, prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious birth defects. \u201cThat\u2019s why some providers and lay people alike think there\u2019s no effect,\u201d said Dr. Erica Wymore, a neonatologist at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado. But she warned, \u201cJust because they don\u2019t have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn\u2019t mean the baby\u2019s neurological development is not impacted.\u201d\n\nMost research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent. Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n\u201cAll those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren\u2019t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,\u201d said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington\u2019s fetal alcohol and drug unit. \u201cWe need to do a whole lot more research now.\u201d\n\nThere are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use. Research is often based on reports by pregnant women \u2014 instead of, say, tests of urine or the umbilical cord \u2014 and they consistently underreport their use. (Researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies.) And pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol; it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself.\n\nFew realize that THC is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother\u2019s body for weeks, if not months. It\u2019s not known whether the fetus\u2019s exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit.\n\nTo find out whether that\u2019s happening, Dr. Judy Chang, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients.\n\nMedical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana, the researchers found, than to advise them of potential risks. When mothers-to-be admitted to marijuana use, almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all.\n\nPregnant women aren\u2019t eager to discuss it, either, because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture.\n\nDepression, anxiety, stress, pain, nausea and vomiting were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 survey of low-income mothers getting federal nutrition help in Colorado. Roughly 6 percent were pot users; a third were pregnant.\n\n\u201cWomen are thinking of this as medical marijuana in that they are treating some condition,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute who researches substance abuse in pregnancy.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to consider it like medicine,\u201d she said, \u201cthen treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it.\u201d\n\nStacey\u2019s son just had his first birthday. He\u2019s walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn\u2019t worried about his development.\n\nShe still smokes pot \u2014 indeed, her son plays on a rug emblazoned with a marijuana leaf. But the severe cramps that plagued her before pregnancy are easing now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to smoke as much anymore,\u201d she said.", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1739:5b14d080-cbf5-4700-919f-b1bc740828ac", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "a6a4d058630efccca1ce1f7e636ca8f3e392460db4e62c2280617edc9b209be0", "id": 86, "metadata": {"article_number": "1739", "filename": "1739SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "09ddb788-c3a6-44e5-a8c2-b6591d4a1f13", "topic_number": 0, "glossary": {}, "name": "Reasoning", "instructions": "Use the \u2018Reasoning\u2019 label on phrases and sentences that include specific and identifiable cognitive biases, psychological biases, argumentative fallacies, or logical errors.

Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use.\n\nIn the federal survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of mothers-to-be said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2.4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.)\n\n[Photo]\n\nStacey\u2019s son just had his first birthday. He\u2019s walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn\u2019t worried about his development. Credit Jennifer Sens for The New York Times\nYoung mothers-to-be were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7.5 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44.\n\nEvidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, 6-year-olds born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention.\n\nMost troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers.\n\n\u201cPrenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,\u201d said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nSeveral studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion.\n\n\u201cEven early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,\u201d said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. \u201cThose are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition.\u201d\n\nIt is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even eventually reducing I.Q.\n\n\u201cThe effects are not dramatic, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are not important,\u201d said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. \u201cIt could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,\u201d she added.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement. But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic.\n\nOf five federal agencies, only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February, according to a study published online in December in the journal Substance Abuse. Only 10 state health departments did.\n\nUntil recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered nothing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think public health officials should be alarming people,\u201d said Marian Jarlenski, the study\u2019s lead author and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. \u201cThey just have to say, \u2018There have been studies done, and there is some risk.\u2019\u201d\n\nGet the best of Well, with the latest on health, fitness and nutrition, delivered to your inbox every week.\n\nYou agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.\n\nSEE SAMPLE PRIVACY POLICY OPT OUT OR CONTACT US ANYTIME\nIn a statement, C.D.C. officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to THC in utero.\n\n\u201cWhile current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent, some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy, such as low birth weight or preterm birth,\u201d the agency said.\n\nDr. Marie McCormick, a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new report on cannabis from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, said smoking cannabis \u201cdoes confer, in terms of birth weight, the same risk as cigarettes.\u201d\n\nSome of the gathering evidence is reassuring. So far, prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious birth defects. \u201cThat\u2019s why some providers and lay people alike think there\u2019s no effect,\u201d said Dr. Erica Wymore, a neonatologist at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado. But she warned, \u201cJust because they don\u2019t have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn\u2019t mean the baby\u2019s neurological development is not impacted.\u201d\n\nMost research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent. Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n\u201cAll those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren\u2019t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,\u201d said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington\u2019s fetal alcohol and drug unit. \u201cWe need to do a whole lot more research now.\u201d\n\nThere are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use. Research is often based on reports by pregnant women \u2014 instead of, say, tests of urine or the umbilical cord \u2014 and they consistently underreport their use. (Researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies.) And pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol; it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself.\n\nFew realize that THC is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother\u2019s body for weeks, if not months. It\u2019s not known whether the fetus\u2019s exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit.\n\nTo find out whether that\u2019s happening, Dr. Judy Chang, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients.\n\nMedical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana, the researchers found, than to advise them of potential risks. When mothers-to-be admitted to marijuana use, almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all.\n\nPregnant women aren\u2019t eager to discuss it, either, because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture.\n\nDepression, anxiety, stress, pain, nausea and vomiting were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 survey of low-income mothers getting federal nutrition help in Colorado. Roughly 6 percent were pot users; a third were pregnant.\n\n\u201cWomen are thinking of this as medical marijuana in that they are treating some condition,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute who researches substance abuse in pregnancy.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to consider it like medicine,\u201d she said, \u201cthen treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it.\u201d\n\nStacey\u2019s son just had his first birthday. He\u2019s walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn\u2019t worried about his development.\n\nShe still smokes pot \u2014 indeed, her son plays on a rug emblazoned with a marijuana leaf.

Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\n\nCleveland Cavaliers basketball star Kyrie Irving has apparently joined the dubious celebrity ranks of former The View host Sherri Shepherd, rapper B.o.B., and reality TV personality Tila Tequila by coming out in public to declare that the world is flat.\n\nIn a recent podcast leading up to the 2017 NBA All-Star Weekend, Irving said:\n\n\u201cFor what I\u2019ve known for many years and what I\u2019ve been taught is that the Earth is round, but if you really think about it from a landscape of the way we travel, the way we move and the fact that \u2014 can you really think of us rotating around the sun, and all planets align, rotating in specific dates, being perpendicular with what\u2019s going on with these planets and stuff like this.\u201d\n\nWith this quotation, Deadspin magazine ran the headline, \u201cKyrie Irving Really, Actually, Earnestly Believes The Earth Is Flat.\u201d\n\nBut does Irving, who spent his freshman year at Duke University before leaving for professional basketball, really, actually, and earnestly believe the earth is flat? Does anyone?\n\nWhile it\u2019s often said that human beings believed that the Earth was flat through the Middle Ages until Christopher Columbus set us straight in 1492, a more historically accurate account tells us that civilization had abandoned flat Earth theories at least a century before that. Educated people have therefore accepted that the world is round for more than half a millennium, with modern claims to the contrary only developing as an organizational creed when Samuel Shenton founded the International Flat Earth Research Society in 1956. Despite NASA astronauts returning with photographs of the Earth taken from the moon in 1969, the membership of the International Flat Earth Research Society peaked to 3500 members in the 1990s and now, with like-minded individuals finding each other on the internet, a number of different online \u201cFlat Earth Societies\u201d have gained modest followings. Armed as we are with common sense, a little bit of scientific knowledge, and the ability to fly around the Earth in an airplane and to view images taken from satellites and the International Space Station, how is this possible? How can people really believe that the Earth isn\u2019t round?\n\nTo understand Flat Earthers, and other people who hold unconventional beliefs, we need to first consider what it means to \u201cbelieve.\u201d A belief is a cognitive representation of the nature of reality, encompassing our inner experiences, the world around us, and the world beyond. In 1965, Oxford philosophy professor H.H. Price distinguished between \u201cbelieving in\u201d and \u201cbelieving that.\u201d1 As summarized by John Byrne, author of the website Skeptical Medicine, \u201cbelieving that\u201d something is true is a relatively straightforward matter of looking at the evidence. \u201cSeeing is believing\u201d is one kind of \u201cbelieving that.\u201d In contrast, we \u201cbelieve in\u201d something when there\u2019s no evidence and the belief isn\u2019t falsifiable. Religious faith is a kind of \u201cbelieving in.\u201d Both types of believing are normal cognitive capacities, but can run amok when conflated, resulting in beliefs that are poor models of reality.\n\nJust so, Flat Earthers often talk about planetary geometry in terms of \u201cbelief in\u201d rather than \u201cbelief that,\u201d as if the evidence for a spherical Earth is lacking. But that claim isn\u2019t really so much about believing. It's denialism.\n\nWhen Kyrie Irving was challenged about his flat earth beliefs, he replied:\n\n\u201cIs the world flat or round? \u2014 I think you need to do research on it. It\u2019s right in front of our faces. I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s right in front of our faces. They lie to us\u2026 Everything that was put in front of me, I had to be like, \u2018Oh, this is all a facade.\u2019 Like, this is all something that they ultimately want me to believe in\u2026 Question things, but even if an answer doesn\u2019t come back, you\u2019re perfectly fine with that, because you were never living in that particular truth. There\u2019s a falseness in stories and things that people want you to believe and ultimately what they throw in front of us.\u201d\n\nWith those words, Irving seems to be defending a denialist position that has the potential to give way to a slippery slope of rejecting all facts. According to that extreme version of denialism, nothing can be trusted, not even scientific evidence. Or maybe, as the physician and writer Atul Gawande wrote last year, it\u2019s not so much about mistrust of science, as it is about mistrusting scientists:\n\n\u201cToday, we have multiple factions putting themselves forward as what Gauchat describes as their own cultural domains, \u201cgenerating their own knowledge base that is often in conflict with the cultural authority of the scientific community.\u201d Some are religious groups (challenging evolution, for instance). Some are industry groups (as with climate skepticism). Others tilt more to the left (such as those that reject the medical establishment). As varied as these groups are, they are all alike in one way. They all harbor sacred beliefs that they do not consider open to question.\n\nTo defend those beliefs, few dismiss the authority of science. They dismiss the authority of the scientific community. People don\u2019t argue back by claiming divine authority anymore. They argue back by claiming to have the truer scientific authority. It can make matters incredibly confusing.\u201d\n\nSure enough, in a follow-up interview in which a reporter asked Irving if he\u2019d seen photographs of the Earth from space, he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of things that my educational system said was real, but turned out to be completely fake.\u201d\n\nThat kind of conspiratorial mistrust of established dogma was mirrored in a Paste magazine interview last year with John Davis, President of the American Flat Earth Society. When asked why he believed the world to be flat, Davis instead explained how he\u2019d arrived at that belief:\n\n\u201cOne day while walking in the woods as a young man I had a notable experience that lead me to question everything I\u2019ve taken for granted as true over the years; all those things we simply accept without properly examining their logical and rational basis and foundations. One could say like many today that up to this point I was standing on the shoulders of giants, but I had a deaf ear to both what they had to say about the matter as well as what assumptions they had to take to lead them to their position. This led me to a lengthy study into various ways we view the world, both orthodox and unorthodox, and their rational consequences and foundations. During this period of study and examination I came to some literature from the Flat Earth Society.\n\nSomething about it just resonated with me\u2014not only on a personal level, but also on a strictly logical level.\n\nOn another level, it seemed to me that some of the method used by this supposedly ridiculous group was far closer to the method of the aforementioned giants than what we see today from science as a whole. I remember thinking, \u2018These are people who truly value knowledge, and they do so at a real cost\u2014social stigma.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis account suggests that Flat Earthers often see themselves as approaching questions about reality like scientists do, from a philosophical perspective of skepticism. But while superficially related, scientific skepticism and denialism aren\u2019t the same thing at all.2 The former teaches that evidence is worthy of belief when an observation is repeated under properly controlled conditions, while the latter teaches that evidence, no matter how reproducible, can always be rejected out of hand as a matter of principle (for more on the distinction, check out Michael Shermer's Living in Denial: When a Sceptic Isn't a Sceptic and Steven Novella's Skepticism and Denial).\n\nWhen B.o.B. and Tila Tequila defended their flat earth beliefs, both fell back on the claim that the Earth can\u2019t be round because it appears flat on the horizon. While this position could be dismissed as mere ignorance grounded in the natural but error-prone tendency of the brain to treat perception as reality, the simultaneous rejection of the mountain of objective evidence to the contrary may further reflect a modern democratization of opinion, with personal belief placed on a equal footing with expertise. That kind of narcissism emboldened B.o.B. to feel qualified to debate physicist Neil Degrasse Tyson and for many others seems to be an increasingly adopted epistemology in today's \u201cpost-truth\u201d world.\n\nSo, does Kyrie Irving really, actually, and earnestly believe that if he kept going in a straight line, he would eventually run smack into the end of the Earth? I doubt it.\n\nInstead, he seems to have chosen a provocative example of scientific consensus to argue, perhaps with tongue in cheek, that we should seek truth and question authority along the way. That\u2019s reasonable advice, so long as we maintain a clear boundary between scientific skepticism and nihilistic denialism.\n\nIn terms of psychological and social health, we would all do well to be more flexible with our personal belief convictions, keeping an open mind to the possibility that we might be wrong. But at the same time, we would also do well to \u201cbelieve in\u201d the process of \u201cbelieving that.\u201d According to that advice, denialism holds us back, tethering us to false beliefs that are inconsistent with the facts and worthy of ridicule.", "metadata": {"article_number": "1731", "filename": "1731SSSArticle.txt"}, "highlight_tasks": [{"id": 144, "uuid": "b3af3a91-39fc-4885-b385-e690b16a8de8", "generator": {"id": 28, "uuid": "2c0af7d1-921b-4b31-bcd6-a825c038e61b", "name": "FormTriager1.1C2", "task_config": {"contributor_id": null, "redundancy": 17, "batchname_regex": "SSSPETest2", "topic_ids": [39, 47, 35]}, "task_type": "HLTR"}, "article_id": 78, "info": {"article": {"article_number": 1731, "text": "title: Flat Earthers: Belief, Skepticism, and Denialism\nAuthor:  Susan Scutti\n\nDate: February 19, 2017\n\n\u201cYou are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in.

No one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know it's going to rise tomorrow.

Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\n\nCleveland Cavaliers basketball star Kyrie Irving has apparently joined the dubious celebrity ranks of former The View host Sherri Shepherd, rapper B.o.B., and reality TV personality Tila Tequila by coming out in public to declare that the world is flat.\n\nIn a recent podcast leading up to the 2017 NBA All-Star Weekend, Irving said:\n\n\u201cFor what I\u2019ve known for many years and what I\u2019ve been taught is that the Earth is round, but if you really think about it from a landscape of the way we travel, the way we move and the fact that \u2014 can you really think of us rotating around the sun, and all planets align, rotating in specific dates, being perpendicular with what\u2019s going on with these planets and stuff like this.\u201d\n\nWith this quotation, Deadspin magazine ran the headline, \u201cKyrie Irving Really, Actually, Earnestly Believes The Earth Is Flat.\u201d\n\nBut does Irving, who spent his freshman year at Duke University before leaving for professional basketball, really, actually, and earnestly believe the earth is flat? Does anyone?\n\nWhile it\u2019s often said that human beings believed that the Earth was flat through the Middle Ages until Christopher Columbus set us straight in 1492, a more historically accurate account tells us that civilization had abandoned flat Earth theories at least a century before that. Educated people have therefore accepted that the world is round for more than half a millennium, with modern claims to the contrary only developing as an organizational creed when Samuel Shenton founded the International Flat Earth Research Society in 1956. Despite NASA astronauts returning with photographs of the Earth taken from the moon in 1969, the membership of the International Flat Earth Research Society peaked to 3500 members in the 1990s and now, with like-minded individuals finding each other on the internet, a number of different online \u201cFlat Earth Societies\u201d have gained modest followings. Armed as we are with common sense, a little bit of scientific knowledge, and the ability to fly around the Earth in an airplane and to view images taken from satellites and the International Space Station, how is this possible? How can people really believe that the Earth isn\u2019t round?\n\nTo understand Flat Earthers, and other people who hold unconventional beliefs, we need to first consider what it means to \u201cbelieve.\u201d A belief is a cognitive representation of the nature of reality, encompassing our inner experiences, the world around us, and the world beyond. In 1965, Oxford philosophy professor H.H. Price distinguished between \u201cbelieving in\u201d and \u201cbelieving that.\u201d1 As summarized by John Byrne, author of the website Skeptical Medicine, \u201cbelieving that\u201d something is true is a relatively straightforward matter of looking at the evidence. \u201cSeeing is believing\u201d is one kind of \u201cbelieving that.\u201d In contrast, we \u201cbelieve in\u201d something when there\u2019s no evidence and the belief isn\u2019t falsifiable. Religious faith is a kind of \u201cbelieving in.\u201d Both types of believing are normal cognitive capacities, but can run amok when conflated, resulting in beliefs that are poor models of reality.\n\nJust so, Flat Earthers often talk about planetary geometry in terms of \u201cbelief in\u201d rather than \u201cbelief that,\u201d as if the evidence for a spherical Earth is lacking. But that claim isn\u2019t really so much about believing. It's denialism.\n\nWhen Kyrie Irving was challenged about his flat earth beliefs, he replied:\n\n\u201cIs the world flat or round? \u2014 I think you need to do research on it. It\u2019s right in front of our faces. I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s right in front of our faces. They lie to us\u2026 Everything that was put in front of me, I had to be like, \u2018Oh, this is all a facade.\u2019 Like, this is all something that they ultimately want me to believe in\u2026 Question things, but even if an answer doesn\u2019t come back, you\u2019re perfectly fine with that, because you were never living in that particular truth. There\u2019s a falseness in stories and things that people want you to believe and ultimately what they throw in front of us.\u201d\n\nWith those words, Irving seems to be defending a denialist position that has the potential to give way to a slippery slope of rejecting all facts. According to that extreme version of denialism, nothing can be trusted, not even scientific evidence. Or maybe, as the physician and writer Atul Gawande wrote last year, it\u2019s not so much about mistrust of science, as it is about mistrusting scientists:\n\n\u201cToday, we have multiple factions putting themselves forward as what Gauchat describes as their own cultural domains, \u201cgenerating their own knowledge base that is often in conflict with the cultural authority of the scientific community.\u201d Some are religious groups (challenging evolution, for instance). Some are industry groups (as with climate skepticism). Others tilt more to the left (such as those that reject the medical establishment). As varied as these groups are, they are all alike in one way. They all harbor sacred beliefs that they do not consider open to question.\n\nTo defend those beliefs, few dismiss the authority of science. They dismiss the authority of the scientific community. People don\u2019t argue back by claiming divine authority anymore. They argue back by claiming to have the truer scientific authority. It can make matters incredibly confusing.\u201d\n\nSure enough, in a follow-up interview in which a reporter asked Irving if he\u2019d seen photographs of the Earth from space, he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of things that my educational system said was real, but turned out to be completely fake.\u201d\n\nThat kind of conspiratorial mistrust of established dogma was mirrored in a Paste magazine interview last year with John Davis, President of the American Flat Earth Society. When asked why he believed the world to be flat, Davis instead explained how he\u2019d arrived at that belief:\n\n\u201cOne day while walking in the woods as a young man I had a notable experience that lead me to question everything I\u2019ve taken for granted as true over the years; all those things we simply accept without properly examining their logical and rational basis and foundations. One could say like many today that up to this point I was standing on the shoulders of giants, but I had a deaf ear to both what they had to say about the matter as well as what assumptions they had to take to lead them to their position. This led me to a lengthy study into various ways we view the world, both orthodox and unorthodox, and their rational consequences and foundations. During this period of study and examination I came to some literature from the Flat Earth Society.\n\nSomething about it just resonated with me\u2014not only on a personal level, but also on a strictly logical level.\n\nOn another level, it seemed to me that some of the method used by this supposedly ridiculous group was far closer to the method of the aforementioned giants than what we see today from science as a whole. I remember thinking, \u2018These are people who truly value knowledge, and they do so at a real cost\u2014social stigma.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis account suggests that Flat Earthers often see themselves as approaching questions about reality like scientists do, from a philosophical perspective of skepticism. But while superficially related, scientific skepticism and denialism aren\u2019t the same thing at all.2 The former teaches that evidence is worthy of belief when an observation is repeated under properly controlled conditions, while the latter teaches that evidence, no matter how reproducible, can always be rejected out of hand as a matter of principle (for more on the distinction, check out Michael Shermer's Living in Denial: When a Sceptic Isn't a Sceptic and Steven Novella's Skepticism and Denial).\n\nWhen B.o.B. and Tila Tequila defended their flat earth beliefs, both fell back on the claim that the Earth can\u2019t be round because it appears flat on the horizon. While this position could be dismissed as mere ignorance grounded in the natural but error-prone tendency of the brain to treat perception as reality, the simultaneous rejection of the mountain of objective evidence to the contrary may further reflect a modern democratization of opinion, with personal belief placed on a equal footing with expertise. That kind of narcissism emboldened B.o.B. to feel qualified to debate physicist Neil Degrasse Tyson and for many others seems to be an increasingly adopted epistemology in today's \u201cpost-truth\u201d world.\n\nSo, does Kyrie Irving really, actually, and earnestly believe that if he kept going in a straight line, he would eventually run smack into the end of the Earth? I doubt it.\n\nInstead, he seems to have chosen a provocative example of scientific consensus to argue, perhaps with tongue in cheek, that we should seek truth and question authority along the way. That\u2019s reasonable advice, so long as we maintain a clear boundary between scientific skepticism and nihilistic denialism.\n\nIn terms of psychological and social health, we would all do well to be more flexible with our personal belief convictions, keeping an open mind to the possibility that we might be wrong. But at the same time, we would also do well to \u201cbelieve in\u201d the process of \u201cbelieving that.\u201d According to that advice, denialism holds us back, tethering us to false beliefs that are inconsistent with the facts and worthy of ridicule.", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1731:37f7429a-5252-42fa-ad0e-5d852a758263", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "bad910fd0ffb399b223269afb4f75029d6e91fb55362ccaad4f28685ff1dc61e", "id": 78, "metadata": {"article_number": "1731", "filename": "1731SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "0ab01231-2f3c-40a4-b791-ed0fa65208ab", "topic_number": 0, "glossary": {}, "name": "Quoted Sources", "instructions": "Use the 'Quoted Sources' label to highlight BOTH the names of anyone (person or organization) quoted or paraphrased in the article AND the quote or paraphrase itself.

Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\n\nCleveland Cavaliers basketball star Kyrie Irving has apparently joined the dubious celebrity ranks of former The View host Sherri Shepherd, rapper B.o.B., and reality TV personality Tila Tequila by coming out in public to declare that the world is flat.\n\nIn a recent podcast leading up to the 2017 NBA All-Star Weekend, Irving said:\n\n\u201cFor what I\u2019ve known for many years and what I\u2019ve been taught is that the Earth is round, but if you really think about it from a landscape of the way we travel, the way we move and the fact that \u2014 can you really think of us rotating around the sun, and all planets align, rotating in specific dates, being perpendicular with what\u2019s going on with these planets and stuff like this.\u201d\n\nWith this quotation, Deadspin magazine ran the headline, \u201cKyrie Irving Really, Actually, Earnestly Believes The Earth Is Flat.\u201d\n\nBut does Irving, who spent his freshman year at Duke University before leaving for professional basketball, really, actually, and earnestly believe the earth is flat? Does anyone?\n\nWhile it\u2019s often said that human beings believed that the Earth was flat through the Middle Ages until Christopher Columbus set us straight in 1492, a more historically accurate account tells us that civilization had abandoned flat Earth theories at least a century before that. Educated people have therefore accepted that the world is round for more than half a millennium, with modern claims to the contrary only developing as an organizational creed when Samuel Shenton founded the International Flat Earth Research Society in 1956. Despite NASA astronauts returning with photographs of the Earth taken from the moon in 1969, the membership of the International Flat Earth Research Society peaked to 3500 members in the 1990s and now, with like-minded individuals finding each other on the internet, a number of different online \u201cFlat Earth Societies\u201d have gained modest followings. Armed as we are with common sense, a little bit of scientific knowledge, and the ability to fly around the Earth in an airplane and to view images taken from satellites and the International Space Station, how is this possible? How can people really believe that the Earth isn\u2019t round?\n\nTo understand Flat Earthers, and other people who hold unconventional beliefs, we need to first consider what it means to \u201cbelieve.\u201d A belief is a cognitive representation of the nature of reality, encompassing our inner experiences, the world around us, and the world beyond. In 1965, Oxford philosophy professor H.H. Price distinguished between \u201cbelieving in\u201d and \u201cbelieving that.\u201d1 As summarized by John Byrne, author of the website Skeptical Medicine, \u201cbelieving that\u201d something is true is a relatively straightforward matter of looking at the evidence. \u201cSeeing is believing\u201d is one kind of \u201cbelieving that.\u201d In contrast, we \u201cbelieve in\u201d something when there\u2019s no evidence and the belief isn\u2019t falsifiable. Religious faith is a kind of \u201cbelieving in.\u201d Both types of believing are normal cognitive capacities, but can run amok when conflated, resulting in beliefs that are poor models of reality.\n\nJust so, Flat Earthers often talk about planetary geometry in terms of \u201cbelief in\u201d rather than \u201cbelief that,\u201d as if the evidence for a spherical Earth is lacking. But that claim isn\u2019t really so much about believing. It's denialism.\n\nWhen Kyrie Irving was challenged about his flat earth beliefs, he replied:\n\n\u201cIs the world flat or round? \u2014 I think you need to do research on it. It\u2019s right in front of our faces. I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s right in front of our faces. They lie to us\u2026 Everything that was put in front of me, I had to be like, \u2018Oh, this is all a facade.\u2019 Like, this is all something that they ultimately want me to believe in\u2026 Question things, but even if an answer doesn\u2019t come back, you\u2019re perfectly fine with that, because you were never living in that particular truth. There\u2019s a falseness in stories and things that people want you to believe and ultimately what they throw in front of us.\u201d\n\nWith those words, Irving seems to be defending a denialist position that has the potential to give way to a slippery slope of rejecting all facts. According to that extreme version of denialism, nothing can be trusted, not even scientific evidence. Or maybe, as the physician and writer Atul Gawande wrote last year, it\u2019s not so much about mistrust of science, as it is about mistrusting scientists:\n\n\u201cToday, we have multiple factions putting themselves forward as what Gauchat describes as their own cultural domains, \u201cgenerating their own knowledge base that is often in conflict with the cultural authority of the scientific community.\u201d Some are religious groups (challenging evolution, for instance). Some are industry groups (as with climate skepticism). Others tilt more to the left (such as those that reject the medical establishment). As varied as these groups are, they are all alike in one way. They all harbor sacred beliefs that they do not consider open to question.\n\nTo defend those beliefs, few dismiss the authority of science. They dismiss the authority of the scientific community. People don\u2019t argue back by claiming divine authority anymore. They argue back by claiming to have the truer scientific authority. It can make matters incredibly confusing.\u201d\n\nSure enough, in a follow-up interview in which a reporter asked Irving if he\u2019d seen photographs of the Earth from space, he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of things that my educational system said was real, but turned out to be completely fake.\u201d\n\nThat kind of conspiratorial mistrust of established dogma was mirrored in a Paste magazine interview last year with John Davis, President of the American Flat Earth Society. When asked why he believed the world to be flat, Davis instead explained how he\u2019d arrived at that belief:\n\n\u201cOne day while walking in the woods as a young man I had a notable experience that lead me to question everything I\u2019ve taken for granted as true over the years; all those things we simply accept without properly examining their logical and rational basis and foundations. One could say like many today that up to this point I was standing on the shoulders of giants, but I had a deaf ear to both what they had to say about the matter as well as what assumptions they had to take to lead them to their position. This led me to a lengthy study into various ways we view the world, both orthodox and unorthodox, and their rational consequences and foundations. During this period of study and examination I came to some literature from the Flat Earth Society.\n\nSomething about it just resonated with me\u2014not only on a personal level, but also on a strictly logical level.\n\nOn another level, it seemed to me that some of the method used by this supposedly ridiculous group was far closer to the method of the aforementioned giants than what we see today from science as a whole. I remember thinking, \u2018These are people who truly value knowledge, and they do so at a real cost\u2014social stigma.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis account suggests that Flat Earthers often see themselves as approaching questions about reality like scientists do, from a philosophical perspective of skepticism. But while superficially related, scientific skepticism and denialism aren\u2019t the same thing at all.2 The former teaches that evidence is worthy of belief when an observation is repeated under properly controlled conditions, while the latter teaches that evidence, no matter how reproducible, can always be rejected out of hand as a matter of principle (for more on the distinction, check out Michael Shermer's Living in Denial: When a Sceptic Isn't a Sceptic and Steven Novella's Skepticism and Denial).\n\nWhen B.o.B. and Tila Tequila defended their flat earth beliefs, both fell back on the claim that the Earth can\u2019t be round because it appears flat on the horizon. While this position could be dismissed as mere ignorance grounded in the natural but error-prone tendency of the brain to treat perception as reality, the simultaneous rejection of the mountain of objective evidence to the contrary may further reflect a modern democratization of opinion, with personal belief placed on a equal footing with expertise. That kind of narcissism emboldened B.o.B. to feel qualified to debate physicist Neil Degrasse Tyson and for many others seems to be an increasingly adopted epistemology in today's \u201cpost-truth\u201d world.\n\nSo, does Kyrie Irving really, actually, and earnestly believe that if he kept going in a straight line, he would eventually run smack into the end of the Earth? I doubt it.\n\nInstead, he seems to have chosen a provocative example of scientific consensus to argue, perhaps with tongue in cheek, that we should seek truth and question authority along the way. That\u2019s reasonable advice, so long as we maintain a clear boundary between scientific skepticism and nihilistic denialism.\n\nIn terms of psychological and social health, we would all do well to be more flexible with our personal belief convictions, keeping an open mind to the possibility that we might be wrong. But at the same time, we would also do well to \u201cbelieve in\u201d the process of \u201cbelieving that.\u201d According to that advice, denialism holds us back, tethering us to false beliefs that are inconsistent with the facts and worthy of ridicule.", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1731:37f7429a-5252-42fa-ad0e-5d852a758263", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "bad910fd0ffb399b223269afb4f75029d6e91fb55362ccaad4f28685ff1dc61e", "id": 78, "metadata": {"article_number": "1731", "filename": "1731SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "d1c04ecf-3302-4584-88a4-184000da3cf5", "topic_number": 1, "glossary": {}, "name": "Fact-check", "instructions": "Highlight claims that are worth the effort of fact-checking.

What makes the findings especially disturbing, said experts not involved in the research, is that when screening guidelines and follow-up monitoring are pursued, cervical cancer is largely preventable.\n\n\u201cThis shows that our disparities are even worse than we feared,\u201d said Dr. Kathleen M.

But this study said that the gap was far greater than believed.\n\nIn the new analysis, the mortality rate for black women was 10.1 per 100,000. For white women, it is 4.7 per 100,000.\n\nPrevious studies had put those figures at 5.7 and 3.2.\n\nThe new rates do not reflect a rise in the number of deaths, which recent estimates put at more than 4,000 a year in the United States. Instead, the figures come from a re-examination of existing numbers, in an adjusted context.\n\nTypically, death rates for cervical cancer are calculated by assessing the number of women who die from a disease against the general population at risk for it. But these epidemiologists, who looked at health data from 2000 to 2012, also excluded women who had had hysterectomies from that larger population. A hysterectomy almost always removes the cervix, and thus the possibility that a woman will develop cervical cancer.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t include men in our calculation because they are not at risk for cervical cancer and by the same measure, we shouldn\u2019t include women who don\u2019t have a cervix,\u201d said Anne F.

A recent study in the journal Gynecologic Oncology that looked at 15,194 patients with advanced cervical cancer found that more than half did not receive treatment considered to be standard of care, and that those patients were more likely to be black and poor.\n\nAccording to the analysis published Monday, the hysterectomy-corrected mortality rates put black American women on par with women living in some underdeveloped countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n[Photo]\n\nDr. M.

About 20 percent of women in the United States have a hysterectomy, often for problems unrelated to cancer, like excessive bleeding and fibroids, with prevalence higher among black women than white.\n\nIn years to come, mortality and incidence rates should decline as more women receive HPV vaccines, which prevents many cervical cancers.\n\nIn recent years, with recognition of the slow progression of the disease, the success of the vaccine and more sophisticated screening tests, guidelines for cervical cancer assessments have shifted. Depending on circumstances, some women need to be screened only every five years.\n\nThe guidelines suggest that screening end at age 65 for women who have had two or three consecutive negative results in the previous decade.\n\nThe current study says that the greatest mortality rates hit black women 85 and older.\n\nBut experts said the new findings did not necessarily point to the need to revisit the upper end of the guidelines. Cervical cancer progresses so slowly, with so many early-warning stages, experts said, that it is highly unlikely that a 65-year-old woman who had met guidelines\u2019 requirements would subsequently develop the disease.\n\nBut given the rigor of the guidelines and screenings, Dr. Rositch said, why do American women not only still get cervical cancer but die from it?

Brawley, the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said that the new study pointed to inequity of access and good treatment.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at the difference between black and white, and rich and poor, we find the same disparity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe quality of assessment and follow-up treatment can be different.

What makes the findings especially disturbing, said experts not involved in the research, is that when screening guidelines and follow-up monitoring are pursued, cervical cancer is largely preventable.\n\n\u201cThis shows that our disparities are even worse than we feared,\u201d said Dr. Kathleen M. Schmeler, an associate professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. \u201cWe have screenings that are great, but many women in America are not getting them. And now I have even more concerns going forward, with the\u201d \u2014 expected \u2014 \u201crepeal of the Affordable Care Act, which covers screening, and the closing of family planning clinics, which do much of that screening.\u201d\n\nThe racial disparity had been noted in earlier studies, but it had been thought to have narrowed because cervical cancer death rates for black women were declining. But this study said that the gap was far greater than believed.\n\nIn the new analysis, the mortality rate for black women was 10.1 per 100,000. For white women, it is 4.7 per 100,000.\n\nPrevious studies had put those figures at 5.7 and 3.2.\n\nThe new rates do not reflect a rise in the number of deaths, which recent estimates put at more than 4,000 a year in the United States. Instead, the figures come from a re-examination of existing numbers, in an adjusted context.\n\nTypically, death rates for cervical cancer are calculated by assessing the number of women who die from a disease against the general population at risk for it. But these epidemiologists, who looked at health data from 2000 to 2012, also excluded women who had had hysterectomies from that larger population. A hysterectomy almost always removes the cervix, and thus the possibility that a woman will develop cervical cancer.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t include men in our calculation because they are not at risk for cervical cancer and by the same measure, we shouldn\u2019t include women who don\u2019t have a cervix,\u201d said Anne F. Rositch, the lead author and an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cIf we want to look at how well our programs are doing, we have to look at the women we\u2019re targeting.\u201d\n\nAlthough the study did not explore reasons for the racial disparity, some doctors said it could reflect unequal access to screening, ability to pursue early-warning test results, and insurance coverage. A recent study in the journal Gynecologic Oncology that looked at 15,194 patients with advanced cervical cancer found that more than half did not receive treatment considered to be standard of care, and that those patients were more likely to be black and poor.\n\nAccording to the analysis published Monday, the hysterectomy-corrected mortality rates put black American women on par with women living in some underdeveloped countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n[Photo]\n\nDr. M. Margaret Kemeny, director of the Queens Cancer Center of Queens Hospital, treats many younger women of color who have a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Credit Joshua Bright for The New York Times\nCertainly removing women who had hysterectomies from the data pool had a significant effect. About 20 percent of women in the United States have a hysterectomy, often for problems unrelated to cancer, like excessive bleeding and fibroids, with prevalence higher among black women than white.\n\nIn years to come, mortality and incidence rates should decline as more women receive HPV vaccines, which prevents many cervical cancers.\n\nIn recent years, with recognition of the slow progression of the disease, the success of the vaccine and more sophisticated screening tests, guidelines for cervical cancer assessments have shifted. Depending on circumstances, some women need to be screened only every five years.\n\nThe guidelines suggest that screening end at age 65 for women who have had two or three consecutive negative results in the previous decade.\n\nThe current study says that the greatest mortality rates hit black women 85 and older.\n\nBut experts said the new findings did not necessarily point to the need to revisit the upper end of the guidelines. Cervical cancer progresses so slowly, with so many early-warning stages, experts said, that it is highly unlikely that a 65-year-old woman who had met guidelines\u2019 requirements would subsequently develop the disease.\n\nBut given the rigor of the guidelines and screenings, Dr. Rositch said, why do American women not only still get cervical cancer but die from it? And with such pronounced racial and age divides?\n\nDr. Otis W. Brawley, the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said that the new study pointed to inequity of access and good treatment.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at the difference between black and white, and rich and poor, we find the same disparity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe quality of assessment and follow-up treatment can be different. The question becomes: how do we get adequate preventive care to all people?\u201d\n\nAlthough this study looked at the divide between black and white women, Dr. Schmeler said that it implicitly raised alarms for other poor women of color. Along border towns in Texas, with an overwhelmingly poor, Hispanic population, she said that rates of incidence and death from cervical cancer were considerably higher than national figures.\n\nStudies such as this latest one consider death rates from a broad epidemiological perspective; statistically, its grimmest news is about older black women. But on the ground, Dr. M. Margaret Kemeny, the director of the Queens Cancer Center of Queens Hospital, a public institution in New York, said she had treated many younger women of color with a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Although the disease is preventable and, if detected early, treatable, Dr. Kemeny\u2019s patients have often never had Pap smears.\n\nShe recently had to perform total pelvic exenterations on two women, each with recurring cervical cancer, one Chinese, the other Hispanic. She removed the cervix, vagina, rectum and bladder, inserting two ostomy bags, which are worn outside the body to collect urine and stool. \u201cOne was 39,\u201d Dr. Kemeny said, \u201cand the other was 25.\u201d", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1738:d88feb08-0529-46e9-bf0e-e1fd461994a5", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "9b9030e7254ff2c88d4b22763f3893d83d65944a9d64e6936f5513f3bbefe242", "id": 85, "metadata": {"article_number": "1738", "filename": "1738SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "0ab01231-2f3c-40a4-b791-ed0fa65208ab", "topic_number": 0, "glossary": {}, "name": "Quoted Sources", "instructions": "Use the 'Quoted Sources' label to highlight BOTH the names of anyone (person or organization) quoted or paraphrased in the article AND the quote or paraphrase itself.

About 20 percent of women in the United States have a hysterectomy, often for problems unrelated to cancer, like excessive bleeding and fibroids, with prevalence higher among black women than white.\n\nIn years to come, mortality and incidence rates should decline as more women receive HPV vaccines, which prevents many cervical cancers.\n\nIn recent years, with recognition of the slow progression of the disease, the success of the vaccine and more sophisticated screening tests, guidelines for cervical cancer assessments have shifted.

Cervical cancer progresses so slowly, with so many early-warning stages, experts said, that it is highly unlikely that a 65-year-old woman who had met guidelines\u2019 requirements would subsequently develop the disease.\n\nBut given the rigor of the guidelines and screenings, Dr. Rositch said, why do American women not only still get cervical cancer but die from it?

Brawley, the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said that the new study pointed to inequity of access and good treatment.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at the difference between black and white, and rich and poor, we find the same disparity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe quality of assessment and follow-up treatment can be different.

A recent study in the journal Gynecologic Oncology that looked at 15,194 patients with advanced cervical cancer found that more than half did not receive treatment considered to be standard of care, and that those patients were more likely to be black and poor.\n\nAccording to the analysis published Monday, the hysterectomy-corrected mortality rates put black American women on par with women living in some underdeveloped countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n[Photo]\n\nDr. M. Margaret Kemeny, director of the Queens Cancer Center of Queens Hospital, treats many younger women of color who have a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Credit Joshua Bright for The New York Times\nCertainly removing women who had hysterectomies from the data pool had a significant effect. About 20 percent of women in the United States have a hysterectomy, often for problems unrelated to cancer, like excessive bleeding and fibroids, with prevalence higher among black women than white.\n\nIn years to come, mortality and incidence rates should decline as more women receive HPV vaccines, which prevents many cervical cancers.\n\nIn recent years, with recognition of the slow progression of the disease, the success of the vaccine and more sophisticated screening tests, guidelines for cervical cancer assessments have shifted. Depending on circumstances, some women need to be screened only every five years.\n\nThe guidelines suggest that screening end at age 65 for women who have had two or three consecutive negative results in the previous decade.\n\nThe current study says that the greatest mortality rates hit black women 85 and older.\n\nBut experts said the new findings did not necessarily point to the need to revisit the upper end of the guidelines. Cervical cancer progresses so slowly, with so many early-warning stages, experts said, that it is highly unlikely that a 65-year-old woman who had met guidelines\u2019 requirements would subsequently develop the disease.\n\nBut given the rigor of the guidelines and screenings, Dr. Rositch said, why do American women not only still get cervical cancer but die from it? And with such pronounced racial and age divides?\n\nDr. Otis W. Brawley, the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said that the new study pointed to inequity of access and good treatment.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at the difference between black and white, and rich and poor, we find the same disparity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe quality of assessment and follow-up treatment can be different. The question becomes: how do we get adequate preventive care to all people?\u201d\n\nAlthough this study looked at the divide between black and white women, Dr. Schmeler said that it implicitly raised alarms for other poor women of color. Along border towns in Texas, with an overwhelmingly poor, Hispanic population, she said that rates of incidence and death from cervical cancer were considerably higher than national figures.\n\nStudies such as this latest one consider death rates from a broad epidemiological perspective; statistically, its grimmest news is about older black women. But on the ground, Dr. M. Margaret Kemeny, the director of the Queens Cancer Center of Queens Hospital, a public institution in New York, said she had treated many younger women of color with a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Although the disease is preventable and, if detected early, treatable, Dr. Kemeny\u2019s patients have often never had Pap smears.\n\nShe recently had to perform total pelvic exenterations on two women, each with recurring cervical cancer, one Chinese, the other Hispanic. She removed the cervix, vagina, rectum and bladder, inserting two ostomy bags, which are worn outside the body to collect urine and stool. \u201cOne was 39,\u201d Dr. Kemeny said, \u201cand the other was 25.\u201d", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1738:d88feb08-0529-46e9-bf0e-e1fd461994a5", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "9b9030e7254ff2c88d4b22763f3893d83d65944a9d64e6936f5513f3bbefe242", "id": 85, "metadata": {"article_number": "1738", "filename": "1738SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "dd6978d0-e168-4599-b8c1-b0fc72585eb5", "topic_number": 2, "glossary": {}, "name": "Language", "instructions": "Use the \u2018Language\u2019 label to highlight for issues of tone and typos.

But now physicists are questioning the conclusion, and they have a much larger dataset to back them up.\n\nFor a bit of background on the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, it was shared between cosmologists Saul Perlmutter from the University of California, Berkeley; Adam Riess from Johns Hopkins University; and Brian Schmidt from the Australian National University.\n\nDuring the 1990s, these three scientists were part of competing teams that were measuring distant Type 1a supernovae - the violent end of a type of star called a white dwarf.\n\nWhite dwarf stars are made from one of the densest forms of matter in the known Universe - surpassed only by neutron stars and black holes.\n\nWhile a typical white dwarf will only be slightly larger than Earth, it will have around the same amount of mass as our Sun. To put that into perspective, you could fit roughly 1,300,000 Earths inside the Sun. \n\nNow imagine that incredibly dense, dead star collapsing under the weight of its own gravity. We're talking about a luminosity level that's about 5 billion times brighter than the Sun.\n\nBecause each Type 1a supernova explodes with roughly the same brightness, the amount of light they give off can be used as an indication of their distance from Earth - and slight shifts in colour can also be used to figure out how fast they're moving.\n\nWhen Perlmutter, Riess, and Schmidt measured all the data for known Type 1a supernovae, recorded by the Hubble space telescope and a number of large ground-based telescopes, they found something incredibly strange. \n\nAs the Royal Swedish Academy explained on the morning of the Nobel Prize announcement in Stockholm:\n\n\"In a Universe which is dominated by matter, one would expect gravity eventually should make the expansion slow down. Imagine then the utter astonishment when two groups of scientists ... discovered that the expansion was not slowing down, it was actually accelerating.\n\nBy comparing the brightness of distant, far-away supernovae with the brightness of nearby supernovae, the scientists discovered that the far-away supernovae were about 25 percent too faint. They were too far away. The Universe was accelerating. And so this discovery is fundamental and a milestone for cosmology. And a challenge for generations of scientists to come.\" \n\nThe find was backed up by data collected separately on things like clustering galaxies and the cosmic microwave background - the faint afterglow of the Big Bang. \n\nAnd earlier this year, NASA and ESA scientists found that the Universe could be expanding around 8 percent faster than originally thought.\n\nBy all accounts, the discovery was a solid one (Nobel Prize solid) but it posed a very difficult question - if the collective gravity from all the matter expelled into the Universe by the Big Bang has been slowing everything down, how can it be accelerating?\n\nAs Brendan Cole reported for us in May:\n\n\"There's something pervading the Universe that physically spreads space apart faster than gravity can pull things together. The effect is small - it's only noticeable when you look at far-away galaxies - but it's there. It's become known as dark energy - 'dark', because no one knows what it is.\"\n\nSince scientists first proposed dark energy, no one's gotten any closer to figuring out what it could actually be.\n\nBut now an international team of physicists have questioned the acceration of the Universe's expansion, and they've got a much bigger database of Type 1a supernovae to back them up.\n\nBy applying a different analytical model to the 740 Type Ia supernovae that have been identified so far, the team says they've been able to account for the subtle differences between them like never before.\n\nThey say the statistical techniques used by the original team were too simplistic, and were based on a model devised in the 1930s, which can't reliability be applied to the growing supernova dataset.\n\nThey also mention that the cosmic microwave background isn't directly affected by dark energy, so only serves as an \"indirect\" type of evidence.\n\n\"We analysed the latest catalogue of 740 Type Ia supernovae - over 10 times bigger than the original samples on which the discovery claim was based - and found that the evidence for accelerated expansion is, at most, what physicists call '3 sigma',\" reports lead researcher, Subir Sarkar, from the University of Oxford.\n\n\"This is far short of the '5 sigma' standard required to claim a discovery of fundamental significance.\"\n\nInstead of finding evidence to support the accelerated expansion of the Universe, Sarkar and his team say it looks like the Universe is expanding at a constant rate.

But now physicists are questioning the conclusion, and they have a much larger dataset to back them up.\n\nFor a bit of background on the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, it was shared between cosmologists Saul Perlmutter from the University of California, Berkeley; Adam Riess from Johns Hopkins University; and Brian Schmidt from the Australian National University.\n\nDuring the 1990s, these three scientists were part of competing teams that were measuring distant Type 1a supernovae - the violent end of a type of star called a white dwarf.\n\nWhite dwarf stars are made from one of the densest forms of matter in the known Universe - surpassed only by neutron stars and black holes.\n\nWhile a typical white dwarf will only be slightly larger than Earth, it will have around the same amount of mass as our Sun. To put that into perspective, you could fit roughly 1,300,000 Earths inside the Sun. \n\nNow imagine that incredibly dense, dead star collapsing under the weight of its own gravity. We're talking about a luminosity level that's about 5 billion times brighter than the Sun.\n\nBecause each Type 1a supernova explodes with roughly the same brightness, the amount of light they give off can be used as an indication of their distance from Earth - and slight shifts in colour can also be used to figure out how fast they're moving.\n\nWhen Perlmutter, Riess, and Schmidt measured all the data for known Type 1a supernovae, recorded by the Hubble space telescope and a number of large ground-based telescopes, they found something incredibly strange. \n\nAs the Royal Swedish Academy explained on the morning of the Nobel Prize announcement in Stockholm:\n\n\"In a Universe which is dominated by matter, one would expect gravity eventually should make the expansion slow down. Imagine then the utter astonishment when two groups of scientists ... discovered that the expansion was not slowing down, it was actually accelerating.\n\nBy comparing the brightness of distant, far-away supernovae with the brightness of nearby supernovae, the scientists discovered that the far-away supernovae were about 25 percent too faint. They were too far away. The Universe was accelerating. And so this discovery is fundamental and a milestone for cosmology. And a challenge for generations of scientists to come.\" \n\nThe find was backed up by data collected separately on things like clustering galaxies and the cosmic microwave background - the faint afterglow of the Big Bang. \n\nAnd earlier this year, NASA and ESA scientists found that the Universe could be expanding around 8 percent faster than originally thought.\n\nBy all accounts, the discovery was a solid one (Nobel Prize solid) but it posed a very difficult question - if the collective gravity from all the matter expelled into the Universe by the Big Bang has been slowing everything down, how can it be accelerating?\n\nAs Brendan Cole reported for us in May:\n\n\"There's something pervading the Universe that physically spreads space apart faster than gravity can pull things together. The effect is small - it's only noticeable when you look at far-away galaxies - but it's there. It's become known as dark energy - 'dark', because no one knows what it is.\"\n\nSince scientists first proposed dark energy, no one's gotten any closer to figuring out what it could actually be.\n\nBut now an international team of physicists have questioned the acceration of the Universe's expansion, and they've got a much bigger database of Type 1a supernovae to back them up.\n\nBy applying a different analytical model to the 740 Type Ia supernovae that have been identified so far, the team says they've been able to account for the subtle differences between them like never before.\n\nThey say the statistical techniques used by the original team were too simplistic, and were based on a model devised in the 1930s, which can't reliability be applied to the growing supernova dataset.\n\nThey also mention that the cosmic microwave background isn't directly affected by dark energy, so only serves as an \"indirect\" type of evidence.\n\n\"We analysed the latest catalogue of 740 Type Ia supernovae - over 10 times bigger than the original samples on which the discovery claim was based - and found that the evidence for accelerated expansion is, at most, what physicists call '3 sigma',\" reports lead researcher, Subir Sarkar, from the University of Oxford.\n\n\"This is far short of the '5 sigma' standard required to claim a discovery of fundamental significance.\"\n\nInstead of finding evidence to support the accelerated expansion of the Universe, Sarkar and his team say it looks like the Universe is expanding at a constant rate. If that's truly the case, it means we don't need dark energy to explain it.\n\n\"A more sophisticated theoretical framework accounting for the observation that the Universe is not exactly homogeneous, and that its matter content may not behave as an ideal gas - two key assumptions of standard cosmology - may well be able to account for all observations without requiring dark energy,\" he says.\n\nNow, to be clear, this is just one study, and it's a big, extremely controversial claim that a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is fundamentally wrong. (Because I don't have to tell you that Nobel Prizes aren't given out lightly.) \n\nBut replication of results is everything in science, and if we have a larger dataset to go on than we did five years ago, we should use it to support - or correct - previous discoveries.\n\nThe question now is whether Sarkar's team applied their new statistical model to the data in a way that best reflects the science, and it will likely spur on a whole lot of physicists to figure out which is right - accelerating Universe, or constant Universe.\n\n\"Naturally, a lot of work will be necessary to convince the physics community of this, but our work serves to demonstrate that a key pillar of the standard cosmological model is rather shaky,\" says Sarkar.\n\n\"Hopefully, this will motivate better analyses of cosmological data, as well as inspiring theorists to investigate more nuanced cosmological models.\" ", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1733:8a7a52f5-e071-41c2-b061-4630f8f029e6", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "3b1f433b349070805f603e74f06a6dcbadd3e53a9f3f6dd20357dba130244bcc", "id": 80, "metadata": {"article_number": "1733", "filename": "1733SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "09ddb788-c3a6-44e5-a8c2-b6591d4a1f13", "topic_number": 0, "glossary": {}, "name": "Reasoning", "instructions": "Use the \u2018Reasoning\u2019 label on phrases and sentences that include specific and identifiable cognitive biases, psychological biases, argumentative fallacies, or logical errors.

And some articles seem to have no argument other than the implied suggestion that the information reported is important enough to be in a newspaper. Each argument in the article should be numbered with its own case flag. And be careful, sometimes an argument is spread across an entire article (i.e. it could start in the first paragraph and finish in the last). Try to highlight only the portions of text that are important to each argument\u2019s logic, evidence, reasoning, and conclusion.", "id": 39, "schema": {"sha256": "534e196ceba6feea0454e567836a361f0741dfe06e7391147a534abee77fe096", "namespace": "Arguments_2018_06_21", "id": 25}}, {"uuid": "3e8dc998-34cc-429f-a6ce-aba91157f82e", "topic_number": 1, "glossary": {}, "name": "Fact-check", "instructions": "The 'Fact-Check' label should be used sparingly, not for every single claim of fact that could be false.

It also tends to favor lean sources of protein like chicken or fish over red meat, which contains more saturated fat.\n\n\u201cOur hypothesis is that these dietary antioxidants may bind to HDL particles and protect them against different kinds of attacks,\u201d Hern\u00e1ez said by email. \u201cAs HDLs are more protected, they can perform their biological functions more efficiently and, therefore, they are able to remove cholesterol from arteries or contribute to the relaxation of blood vessels for longer.\u201d\n\nHigh levels of low density lipoproteins (LDL) or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol and fats known as triglycerides are associated with an increased risk of heart and blood vessel diseases. HDL, or \u201cgood,\u201d cholesterol is associated with a lower risk because it helps remove excess LDL from the bloodstream.\n\nFor the current study, Hern\u00e1ez and colleagues examined data on 296 older adults at risk for cardiovascular disease who were randomly assigned to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with one liter per week (about 34 fluid ounces) of extra virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with 30 grams (1 oz) of nuts a day, or a low-fat diet.\n\nParticipants were 66 years old on average, and they were asked to follow their assigned diet for one year.\n\nOnly the low-fat diet was associated with reduced LDL and total cholesterol levels, researchers report in a paper scheduled for publication in the journal Circulation.\n\nNone of the diets increased HDL levels significantly.\n\nBut blood tests and lab work showed better HDL functioning in the group assigned to the Mediterranean diet with extra olive oil.\n\nWhile some previous research has linked a Mediterranean diet to weight loss and a reduced risk of heart disease and some cancers, scientists haven\u2019t conclusively proven that the diet itself is responsible, instead of other lifestyle choices made by people who eat this way.\n\nLimitations of the current study include the fact that all three diets were relatively healthy, making it difficult to detect meaningful differences in outcomes, the authors note.\n\nStill, the findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that HDL function may influence cardiovascular disease risk, Dr. Daniel Rader of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia writes in an accompanying editorial.\n\n\u201cWe know the Mediterranean diet reduces risk of heart disease but still don\u2019t know exactly why,\u201d Rader said by email. \u201cThere is probably more than one reason, and this study suggests that one mechanism might be that the Mediterranean diet improves the function of HDL.\u201d\n\nEven without clear evidence explaining why the Mediterranean diet may help the heart, eating this way can still make sense, Rader added.\n\n\u201cFor people who are interested in reducing their risk of heart disease, the Mediterranean diet is probably the best proven diet to reduce risk,\u201d Rader said. \u201cI think the majority of people who don\u2019t have other major dietary concerns should look toward the Mediterranean diet as a heart healthy diet.\u201d\n\n", "uri": "urn:SSSPETest2:1728:9a5eddfd-cdd4-477a-af83-3a45d696ec20", "batch_name": "SSSPETest2", "sha256": "b3ab388528c6115f1d85529f203b533fb84143f467acfc31d289bdc58c08d49d", "id": 75, "metadata": {"article_number": "1728", "filename": "1728SSSArticle.txt"}}, "topics": [{"uuid": "0ab01231-2f3c-40a4-b791-ed0fa65208ab", "topic_number": 0, "glossary": {}, "name": "Quoted Sources", "instructions": "Use the 'Quoted Sources' label to highlight BOTH the names of anyone (person or organization) quoted or paraphrased in the article AND the quote or paraphrase itself.
