These emails show that the leadership of State, NSC, and the White House were all informed about the Ukraine efforts from May 23, 2019, until the security aid was released on September 11, 2019. I will quote from some of those messages with you shortly.

Having access to the State Department materials would have been very helpful to me in trying to reconstruct with whom I spoke and met, when, and what was said.

My lawyers and I have made multiple requests to the State Department and the White House for these materials. Yet, these materials were not provided to me. They have also refused to share these materials with this Committee. These documents are not classified and, in fairness, should have been made available. In the absence of these materials, my memory has not been perfect. And I have no doubt that a more fair, open, and orderly process of allowing me to read the State Department records would have made this process more transparent//Within my State Department emails, there is a July 19 email that I sent to Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry, Brian McCormack (Perry’s Chief of Staff), Ms. Kenna, Acting Chief of Staff and OMB Director Mick Mulvaney (White House), and Mr. Mulvaney’s Senior Advisor Robert Blair. A lot of senior officials. Here is my exact quote from that email:

“I Talked to Zelensky just now… He is prepared to receive Potus’ call. Will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will ‘turn over every stone’. He would greatly appreciate a call prior to Sunday so that he can put out some media about a ‘friendly and productive call’ (no details) prior to Ukraine election on Sunday.” Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney responded: “I asked NSC to set it up for tomorrow//Before the September 1 Warsaw meeting, the Ukrainians had become aware that the security funds had yet to be disbursed. In the absence of any credible explanation for the hold, I came to the conclusion that the aid, like the White House visit, was jeopardized. In preparation for the September 1 Warsaw meeting, I asked Secretary Pompeo whether a face-to- face conversation between Trump with Zelensky could help break the logjam. Specifically, on Thursday, August 22, I emailed Secretary Pompeo directly, copying Secretariat Kenna. I wrote:

“Should we block time in Warsaw for a short pull-aside for Potus to meet Zelensky? I would ask Zelensky to look him in the eye and tell him that once Ukraine’s new justice folks are in place ([in] mid-Sept[ember), that Ze should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to Potus [an acronym for the President of the United States] and to the US. Hopefully, that will break the logjam [on funding//Secretary Pompeo replied, “Yes.”

I followed up the next day asking to “get 10-15 min on the Warsaw sched[ule] for this.” I said, “I’d like to know when it is locked so that I can call Zelensky and brief him//There was a September 1 meeting with President Zelensky in Warsaw. Unfortunately, President Trump’s attendance at the Warsaw meeting was cancelled [sic] due to Hurrican Dorian. Vice President Pence attended instead. I mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations. I recall mentioning that before the Zelensky meeting.

During the actual meeting, President Zelensky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice President Pence. The Vice President said he would speak to President Trump about it. Based on my communications with Secretary Pompeo, I felt comfortable sharing my concerns with Mr. Yermak. In a very brief pull-aside conversation, that happened within a few seconds, I told Mr. Yermak that I believed that the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many weeks//When the president says ‘go talk to my personal attorney’ and then Giuliani makes certain demands, then we assume it is from the president//insidious","Using the highlight options below, indicate which portions of the bolded text are:",Direct quote

Like, my cancer charity that I was running had a big annual dinner where I’d give myself an award for philanthropy every year, and we’d have a silent auction and do all kinds of fun things like that. But I would always have it happen at Mar-a-Lago, which my family owns. My dad would give me a commission for booking the charity events there, and that was just one of the many ways we figured out how to funnel those charitable donations we were collecting all year into our personal accounts. Because the government doesn’t just let you withdraw the money, you know? New York especially gets really annoying about that. But the best part is that, since it was my charity, I could charge it whatever I wanted to stay at Mar-a-Lago! I would charge double the reservation fees, double the cost per plate for the dinner, and I’d even take the servers’ tips and the bartenders’ tips for a little extra cash. Always do cash when you can, that’s an insider’s tip from me to you. The best part about cash transactions is you don’t have to claim it on your taxes! The government doesn’t have to know, ya feel me? Man, I made so much money off my cancer charity that it shouldn’t have been legal! Well, technically it wasn’t, and now I can’t do it for ten years, but, boy, when this decade is up and I can go back to booking charity events at my family’s properties, I’m gonna make so much money again!
