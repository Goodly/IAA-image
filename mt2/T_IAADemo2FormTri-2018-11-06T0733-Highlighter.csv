Recent brain science suggests there are measurable differences in how liberal and conservative brains process information\u2014distinctions that could have significant impact on what happens on Election Day

So, we might expect to see progressive ideology in people with more active dopamine circuits. And that\u2019s just what we do find. Researchers from the University of California discovered that people who inherit particularly active dopamine receptor genes are more likely to subscribe to a liberal ideology"

They value tradition"

If a hundred liberals are marching down the street, it\u2019s most likely a protest. With conservatives, it\u2019s probably a parade"

Why? Because conservative brains, chemically inclined toward preserving the here and now, are more sensitive to threats that might undermine their current way of life"

Also, when presented with a selection of positive and negative images, conservatives spent more time gazing at the negative images\u2014pictures that represented a threat"

News articles that describe public harassment by activists, for example, trigger threat circuits in the brain and can turn the ordinarily complacent conservative into an enthusiastic partisan"

They disagree about immigration, global warming and health care. They consume different brands. The stereotypes tell us liberals eat arugula and drive hatchbacks, while conservatives prefer pork rinds and pickup trucks"

What we have is experienced through the five senses plus our emotions. The brain uses a cocktail of chemicals to orchestrate these experiences that might be called the \u201cHere & Now\u201d brain chemicals, chemicals like oxytocin, which encourages us focus on intimate relationships, and endorphins, which provide feelings of fulfillment and satisfaction"
