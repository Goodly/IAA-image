Date: November 19, 2019

No Shots Fired! You are probably not going to see that headline on a Mainstream Media Article. It is an inconvenient truth that they do not want to highlight.

That truth is… the mere presence of a gun frequently can stop crime with no shots fired. It is possible, that this occurs as often as, or MORE often than the actual firing of a gun to stop crime.

No shots fired, is not reported for two main reasons. In a majority of cases, the police do not even find out. A citizen presents a gun when faced with a crime, and the perp runs away. The citizen either doesn’t call the police. Or they do call but are told that since it’s not an active crime scene, it may be an hour or two before an officer responds, and the citizen having better things to do, declines to have an officer take a report. Therefore, the MSM has no way of knowing it happened. That is an easy out for the MSM. They do not have superpowers, so you have to give that one to them.

However, if the MSM does find out, it is not reported, because it does not fit the narrative. A narrative that demands that guns are bad, and anytime a gun is produced, someone dies. (Or at least gets shot).

Today is a rare case. While no one else is reporting it as “no shots fired,” the situation where the presence and presentation of a gun ended a gunman’s attack did happen. And the news is actually trending in national news and making it to the top page on many news sites. However, the hero of the day, gets less lines of reporting than the witness!

[Don’t get me started about how this is a MKUltra operation to fill the news cycle before this week’s new “peach mints” disaster starts again]

I wish the news would just level with everyone, and celebrate the heroics of that citizen that stopped a gunman with his own gun and make it the focus of their articles. However, at this point, I am happy that they are at least mentioning the fact that it happened at all in their articles.

At the Walmart in Duncan, Oklahoma, just before 10am, a gunman fired into a car, killing two victims in the parking lot.

KOCO News reports a witness, Aaron Helton, claimed that the shooter fired nine rounds into the car, killing the two victims.

A total of 3 people are dead, two men and a woman. One of the dead men is the shooter. A connection has not been confirmed between the victims and shooter, however, family members on sight; say it was part of a domestic dispute between a husband and wife. They offered no additional info.

The female victim was an employee at Walmart.

Author: Melanie Davidson 
Date: November 18, 2019

There has been speculation for awhile regarding Mr. Trump’s physical health due to the fact that he is obese and seems to live on a fast food diet. Last January, it was announced that Trump has a common form of heart disease.

It was just announced that Mr. Trump spent more than two hours at Walter Reed Medical Center on Saturday. The White House said that he was having medical tests as part of a physical.

However, CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta said on Sunday that it wasn’t a typical medical exam done every year for presidents. He said that if a president has medical issues that is usually done by doctors on duty at the White House and there isn’t a need to go to the hospital.

CNN: 
President Trump's visit to Walter Reed on Saturday did not follow the protocol of a routine presidential medical exam, according to a person familiar with the matter. https://cnn.it/2Kv6NQy 
Trump's visit to Walter Reed 'not protocol' for routine visit, source says
President Donald Trump's visit to Walter Reed on Saturday did not follow the protocol of a routine presidential medical exam, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Gupta said:

‘NO QUESTION, THIS SOUNDS A BIT UNUSUAL. I MEAN TYPICALLY EVEN WITH THIS WHITE HOUSE, WE’VE GOTTEN PLENTY OF NOTICE IN THE PAST THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO BE GETTING A PHYSICAL EXAM, THAT IT WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE AT WALTER REED, WHICH IT HAS IN THE PAST. EVERYONE INSTITUTION-WIDE RECEIVED NOTICE, AND IT DOESN’T SEEM LIKE THAT HAPPENED IN THIS CASE.’

According to CNN:

‘MEDICAL STAFF AT WALTER REED DID NOT GET A STAFF-WIDE NOTICE ABOUT A PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO THE MEDICAL CENTER IN BETHESDA, MARYLAND, AHEAD OF TRUMP’S ARRIVAL ACCORDING TO THAT SOURCE.

‘TYPICALLY WALTER REED’S MEDICAL STAFF WOULD GET A GENERAL NOTICE ABOUT A “VIP” VISIT TO THE MEDICAL CENTER AHEAD OF A PRESIDENTIAL VISIT, NOTIFYING THEM OF CERTAIN CLOSURES AT THE FACILITY. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN THIS TIME, INDICATING THE VISIT WAS A NON-ROUTINE VISIT AND SCHEDULED LAST MINUTE.’

Typically, all medical staff at Walter Reed would be aware if the president was coming. However, it is possible that a small group of doctors involved in Trump’s medical exams were notified before he arrived.

CNN reported:

‘THE PRESIDENT’S MOTORCADE DROVE TO THE MEDICAL CENTER UNANNOUNCED, WITH REPORTERS UNDER DIRECTION NOT TO REPORT HIS MOVEMENT UNTIL THEY ARRIVED SATURDAY AT WALTER REED.

We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani. Simply put, we played the hand we were dealt.

We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose an important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine.

So we followed the President’s orders//I have now identified certain State Department emails and messages that provide contemporaneous support for my view. These emails show that the leadership of State, NSC, and the White House were all informed about the Ukraine efforts from May 23, 2019, until the security aid was released on September 11, 2019. I will quote from some of those messages with you shortly.

Having access to the State Department materials would have been very helpful to me in trying to reconstruct with whom I spoke and met, when, and what was said.

My lawyers and I have made multiple requests to the State Department and the White House for these materials. Yet, these materials were not provided to me. They have also refused to share these materials with this Committee. These documents are not classified and, in fairness, should have been made available. In the absence of these materials, my memory has not been perfect. And I have no doubt that a more fair, open, and orderly process of allowing me to read the State Department records would have made this process more transparent//Within my State Department emails, there is a July 19 email that I sent to Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry, Brian McCormack (Perry’s Chief of Staff), Ms. Kenna, Acting Chief of Staff and OMB Director Mick Mulvaney (White House), and Mr. Mulvaney’s Senior Advisor Robert Blair. A lot of senior officials. Here is my exact quote from that email:

“I Talked to Zelensky just now… He is prepared to receive Potus’ call. Will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will ‘turn over every stone’. He would greatly appreciate a call prior to Sunday so that he can put out some media about a ‘friendly and productive call’ (no details) prior to Ukraine election on Sunday.” Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney responded: “I asked NSC to set it up for tomorrow//Before the September 1 Warsaw meeting, the Ukrainians had become aware that the security funds had yet to be disbursed. In the absence of any credible explanation for the hold, I came to the conclusion that the aid, like the White House visit, was jeopardized. In preparation for the September 1 Warsaw meeting, I asked Secretary Pompeo whether a face-to- face conversation between Trump with Zelensky could help break the logjam. Specifically, on Thursday, August 22, I emailed Secretary Pompeo directly, copying Secretariat Kenna. I wrote:

“Should we block time in Warsaw for a short pull-aside for Potus to meet Zelensky? I would ask Zelensky to look him in the eye and tell him that once Ukraine’s new justice folks are in place ([in] mid-Sept[ember), that Ze should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to Potus [an acronym for the President of the United States] and to the US. Hopefully, that will break the logjam [on funding].”

Secretary Pompeo replied, “Yes.”

I followed up the next day asking to “get 10-15 min on the Warsaw sched[ule] for this.” I said, “I’d like to know when it is locked so that I can call Zelensky and brief him//There was a September 1 meeting with President Zelensky in Warsaw. Unfortunately, President Trump’s attendance at the Warsaw meeting was cancelled [sic] due to Hurrican Dorian. Vice President Pence attended instead. I mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations. I recall mentioning that before the Zelensky meeting.

During the actual meeting, President Zelensky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice President Pence. The Vice President said he would speak to President Trump about it. Based on my communications with Secretary Pompeo, I felt comfortable sharing my concerns with Mr. Yermak. In a very brief pull-aside conversation, that happened within a few seconds, I told Mr. Yermak that I believed that the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many weeks//When the president says ‘go talk to my personal attorney’ and then Giuliani makes certain demands, then we assume it is from the president//a presidential extortion plot which Ambassador Sondland characterized as “insidious","Using the highlight options below, indicate which portions of the bolded text are:",Direct quote

Like, my cancer charity that I was running had a big annual dinner where I’d give myself an award for philanthropy every year, and we’d have a silent auction and do all kinds of fun things like that. But I would always have it happen at Mar-a-Lago, which my family owns. My dad would give me a commission for booking the charity events there, and that was just one of the many ways we figured out how to funnel those charitable donations we were collecting all year into our personal accounts. Because the government doesn’t just let you withdraw the money, you know? New York especially gets really annoying about that. But the best part is that, since it was my charity, I could charge it whatever I wanted to stay at Mar-a-Lago! I would charge double the reservation fees, double the cost per plate for the dinner, and I’d even take the servers’ tips and the bartenders’ tips for a little extra cash. Always do cash when you can, that’s an insider’s tip from me to you. The best part about cash transactions is you don’t have to claim it on your taxes! The government doesn’t have to know, ya feel me? Man, I made so much money off my cancer charity that it shouldn’t have been legal! Well, technically it wasn’t, and now I can’t do it for ten years, but, boy, when this decade is up and I can go back to booking charity events at my family’s properties, I’m gonna make so much money again!
