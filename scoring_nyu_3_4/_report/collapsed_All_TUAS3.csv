Like, my cancer charity that I was running had a big annual dinner where I\u2019d give myself an award for philanthropy every year, and we\u2019d have a silent auction and do all kinds of fun things like that. But I would always have it happen at Mar-a-Lago, which my family owns. My dad would give me a commission for booking the charity events there, and that was just one of the many ways we figured out how to funnel those charitable donations we were collecting all year into our personal accounts. Because the government doesn\u2019t just let you withdraw the money, you know? New York especially gets really annoying about that. But the best part is that, since it was my charity, I could charge it whatever I wanted to stay at Mar-a-Lago! I would charge double the reservation fees, double the cost per plate for the dinner, and I\u2019d even take the servers\u2019 tips and the bartenders\u2019 tips for a little extra cash.
