The team believes that may be related to the brain working harder to learn new ways of moving related to the lack of gravity. The scans also showed that the changes were more dramatic in the astronauts who spent months aboard the ISS as opposed to those who only had brief trips aboard the shuttle"

But he speculates babies who go on to become autistic experience the world differently in the first year of life than kids who will not have autism do—and that this altered experience of the world may contribute to subsequent brain development in autism"
